<br/>It has been shown to <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/blog/filter/2006/05/the_worlds_most.html">help with Alzheimer's disease</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>Named the world's most soothing robot by Guinness World Records, the robot can express emotions and react sensitively to humans by cooing, moving delicately and opening and closing its eyes. It looks happy when patted on the head and gets angry when ignored. Paro has been shown to help people suffering from Alzheimer's disease and mental disorders by reducing stress, activating the immune system and stabilizing heart rate and blood pressure.</blockquote>

<content type="application/xhtml+xml" xml:base="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog" xml:space="preserve">
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I was reading this piece in the Boston Globe about a new malpractice proposal.  Of course, <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/05/23/healey_candidate_for_governor_proposes_malpractice_overhaul/">Studdert's malpractice findings are trotted out</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>A study released by the Harvard School of Public Health earlier this month found that about 40 percent of the medical malpractice cases filed in the United States are groundless. Many of the lawsuits analyzed contained no evidence that a medical error was committed or that the patient suffered any injury, the researchers reported.<br/>
<br/>The vast majority of those dubious cases were dismissed with no payout to the patient. However, groundless lawsuits still accounted for 15 percent of the money paid out in settlements or verdicts.</blockquote>A 40 percent groundless case rate and a 15 percent chance of a payday in these baseless cases - sounds pretty broken to me. But here's the next paragraph:<br/>
<blockquote>The study's lead researcher, David Studdert of the Harvard School of Public Health, said the findings challenge the view among tort reform supporters that the legal system is riddled with frivolous claims that lead to exorbitant payouts.</blockquote>Huh?  Again, Studdert's biased conclusions completely go against the results of his own study.</div>

Medicine aims to become a team effort. And scientists are in urgent need of more public support. All this will only be achieved, as Harry Cayton, the patient tsar has noted, if medical scientists change their approach and "begin to talk with us, rather than at us". Yesterday's declaration had the smack of yesterday's medical men failing to see the difference between wellbeing and clinical outcomes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Irene Triplett's lawyer, Bruce Fagel, said that Lee ordered the nurses to give Versed, a sedative, to calm Gomez before surgery. At the post-anesthesia care unit, Gomez was given two injections of two milligrams of morphine. The injections were 10 minutes apart, Fagel said. The morphine was given because a nurse thought Gomez was in pain because he was "moaning." Those drugs caused him to stop breathing, Fagel contends.<br/>
<br/>Defense attorneys are denying their clients were responsible. Experts testified about the effects of drugs and how they might have affected Gomez's medical condition, obstructive sleep apnea. Also, the surgery was complicated because he had a large tongue, small airway and large tonsils, characteristics of Down syndrome. They also have pointed out to jurors that Gomez was 4 feet 10 inches tall and was overweight at 176 pounds. </blockquote>2mg of morphine 10 minutes apart should not lead to respiratory failure.</div>

<content type="application/xhtml+xml" xml:base="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog" xml:space="preserve">
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This has been discussed before here.  This is a <a href="http://www.upi.com/HealthBusiness/view.php?StoryID=20060517-033610-2652r">fantastic idea</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>Drexel University in Philadelphia is offering a new "mini medical school" for trial lawyers to learn about their clients' conditions.<br/>
<br/>The program, offered through a partnership between the university's medical and law schools, is sponsored by the Philadelphia Trial Lawyers Association and the Philadelphia Association of Defense Counsel.<br/>
<br/>The program is designed to help trial attorneys better evaluate potential claims and defenses, and arrives just at the end of a medical-liability debate in Congress that pitted doctor and trial-lawyer associations against each other.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>I would like to introduce <a href="http://www.phreesia.com/home.asp">Phreesia</a> as the newest sponsor to <span style="font-style: italic;">Kevin, M.D.</span>  From the website:<br/>
<blockquote>Phreesia is devoted to changing the patient visit to the doctor. We focus on deploying applications that allow doctors to increase productivity, code higher and provide a better patient experience and do this without burdening the doctor with new costs. The Phreesia applications are deployed on our office based network of wireless WebPads with a proprietary content delivery network and computerized patient history. </blockquote>I had the opportunity to sample Phreesia in my office.  The goal is to improve the waiting room experience - an opportunity indeed ripe for the picking.  Instead of magazines, a number of Phreesia WebPads are passed out to patients.  They can be configured to take a medical history, registration information, or the patient can browse medical information.  In the future, output from the devices can interface directly with an EHR (which would be a killer feature).<br/>
<br/>I liked the concept and the technology.  The wireless WebPads are robustly built, and are replaced free if it breaks.  When asked about theft, the Phreesia rep mentioned that it hasn't been a problem as they don't function outside the physician's office.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.phreesia.com/images/3web_pads2.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; width: 200px;"/>
</a>
<br/>
<br/>Using a patient's waiting room time to help with documentation is appealing, as well as having them read about disease prevention rather than magazines.  Also, these devices can give any office a "technology buzz" as word-of-mouth spreads.  Phreesia is definitely an innovative idea that deserves consideration is any physician's practice.<br/>

<content type="application/xhtml+xml" xml:base="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog" xml:space="preserve">
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thanks <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/DavidStuddert.html">Mr. Studdert</a> for giving us the study that highlights the glaring flaws of our malpractice system.  No matter how it is spun, the numbers <a href="http://thismakesmesick.typepad.com/this_makes_me_sick/2006/05/do_the_math_but.html">clearly speak for themselves</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>Finally, the fact that payment was made in 19 percent of claims with little-to-no evidence of error and 32 percent in a slight-to-modest evidence of error is evidence enough that the tort system is woefully inadequate from the physician's perspective. Add into that the fact that the median time to closure was five years.<br/>
<br/>It is no wonder, then, that physicians will be incentivized to order tests and perform procedures to avoid being sued, whether such tactics work or not. That cost almost certainly outweighs the total cost of professional liability premiums physicians pay in the United States.<br/>
<br/>It is helpful to think about a group - a large group - not mentioned in the study. There are currently 46 million uninsured Americans. Improving the medical malpractice system would lessen the costs of defensive medicine, which would provide a stable source of funding for health insurance - and better healthcare and a better quality of life -- for every American.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But a number of doctors say such an impact is more problematic when the beauty treatment being featured is medical, with possible complications, rather than simply a cosmetic or spa procedure. In its desire to be the first show to introduce the latest anti-wrinkle options, "Oprah" sometimes features treatments before doctors have determined how effective they are, who they are best suited for and how safe they are, according to some leading dermatologists and plastic surgeons.</blockquote>

<content type="application/xhtml+xml" xml:base="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog" xml:space="preserve">
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">USA Today tries to get a straight answer and finds that it's <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/2006-05-09-health-shoppers-usat_x.htm">nearly impossible</a>.  The reason is because of the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-05-21-letters-health-care_x.htm">insurance companies</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>USA TODAY's story on the difficulties consumers encounter in getting information on health care prices leaves the impression that doctors are unwilling to disclose their prices. In truth, a typical doctor might have 20 or more prices for the same procedure — because each insurer establishes its own contracted payment amount for a particular service.<br/>
<br/>So, it is not a simple matter to ask, "How much will this cost?"<br/>
<br/>An accurate answer usually requires the doctor to research his contract with the patient's insurer. In many instances, medical practices are not given access to what insurers pay for certain services even during contract negotiations. Lack of transparency between the health plan and the medical practice regarding pricing often makes it impossible for physicians to quote prices to patients.<br/>
<br/>But the greater problem is that most insurers do not permit doctors to disclose what the insurer pays them. These contractual confidentiality clauses, intended to protect "proprietary information," act against the best interests of both patients and doctors.<br/>
<br/>Insurance reform to do away with such prohibitions against disclosure would go far to make the health care market more transparent — and more price competitive.</blockquote>

<content type="application/xhtml+xml" xml:base="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog" xml:space="preserve">
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not the thrust of this article, but I found <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_22/b3986015.htm?chan=tc">this point interesting</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>With this in mind, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Presbyterian Hospital installed alcohol-wash dispensers in every room and allowed nurses to ban doctors who don't wash up from entering patients' rooms. Yet more than one-quarter of UPMC's doctors still haven't gotten the message . . .<br/>
<br/>One major cause for such huge gaps in care is that financial incentives can be skewed. Insurance companies, which have learned that high infection rates cost them money, are beginning to provide bonuses to encourage hospitals to make big improvements . . .<br/>
<br/>But doctors don't have the same incentives. They are usually not hospital employees and are paid based on the number of patients they see and procedures they do. Repeatedly stopping to wash up may slow them down and cost them money.</blockquote>

<title mode="escaped" type="text/html">Why doctors order unnecessary tests</title>
<content mode="escaped" type="text/html" xml:base="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog" xml:space="preserve">I'm happy that &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/19/health/webmd/main1637144.shtml"&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; is getting some play in the media.  Essentially, many of the "routine" tests done on a physical are not recommended (the &lt;a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2005/06/annual-physical-is-useless-but-we.html"&gt;whole concept of a "routine physical" is controversial&lt;/a&gt; - but that's for another discussion).  Merenstein concludes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;# 37 percent of checkups included a urinalysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# 9 percent of checkups included an electrocardiogram.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# 8 percent of checkups included an X-ray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# 43 percent of checkups included at least one of these three tests.&lt;/blockquote&gt;None of these studies are recommended screening tests by the &lt;a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstfix.htm"&gt;USPSTF&lt;/a&gt;.  I have written previously about &lt;a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2005/07/dick-cheneys-physical-analysis.html"&gt;what routine tests should be done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why are they being ordered?  There are several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;1) Blame the media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mainstream media continues to push a "more testing equals better medicine" philosophy.  &lt;a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2006/03/is-it-time-to-step-up-defense-tabloid.html"&gt;High-profile malpractice cases&lt;/a&gt; often highlight missed diagnoses due to a failure to test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Publications like &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/health/2006/05/09/executive-health-list_cx_sy_0510feat2_ls.html"&gt;this article from Forbes&lt;/a&gt; continues to push evidence-bereft screening tests:&lt;blockquote&gt;Among the battery of screening tests you could talk to your doctor about getting: a lipid profile that includes a C-reactive protein measurement, a colonoscopy if you're over 50 (or earlier if you're at high risk for colorectal cancer), a diabetes risk test (fasting plasma glucose test or the oral glucose tolerance test), a stress test and a skin cancer exam.&lt;/blockquote&gt;There is no evidence to support a screening CRP, &lt;a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf/uspsacad.htm"&gt;stress test&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf/uspsskca.htm"&gt;skin cancer screening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;2) "Defensive medicine"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blog's &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;amp;amp;amp;client=pub-0760851763536344&amp;cof=FORID%3A1%3BGL%3A1%3BBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BT%3A%23000000%3BLC%3A%230000ff%3BVLC%3A%23663399%3BALC%3A%230000ff%3BGALT%3A%23008000%3BGFNT%3A%230000ff%3BGIMP%3A%230000ff%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3BLBGC%3A336699%3BAH%3Acenter%3B&amp;amp;domains=kevinmd.com&amp;q=defensive+medicine&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;sitesearch=kevinmd.com"&gt;favorite buzzword&lt;/a&gt;.  It seems that Merenstein has taken up a crusade against unnecessary testing after being &lt;a href="http://depts.washington.edu/gim/calendar/hmcjc_abstracts/JCJul04Article1.pdf"&gt;burned as a resident&lt;/a&gt;.   Good for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not start another discussion about this topic and have the contrarian folks come back with how little data there is that defensive medicine exists/decreases lawsuits/lowers malpractice premiums etc.  Instead, I will speak only for myself.  If there were no-fault malpractice, health courts, or even caps (which I think is the least-effective solution), I would order less diagnostic tests.   Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;3) Reimbursement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reimbursement in the US is essentially fee-for-service.  Physicians get paid a set amount from an insurance company or Medicare/Medicaid for every service that they do.  With reimbursements declining and overhead increasing, ordering more tests generates more revenue for a practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this is a ridiculous system for which there is no easy solution.  Capitation was tried and failed miserably.  Pay-for-performance is an untested answer.  Increasing reimbursement may relieve some of the financial pressures physicians have to keep a practice afloat - subsequently decreasing the need for unnecessary testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as there is a fee for every service performed, there will continue to be an underlying financial incentive to order tests.  That's the simple reality - interpret that as you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;4) "Consumer-driven healthcare" &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another buzzword.  There is a push for patients, I mean "healthcare consumers", to shoulder a bigger financial responsibility for their health.  With the media publicizing non-evidence-based testing (see point 1), consumers will have a greater say in what tests are ordered.  It is their right after all - since they are paying for the tests.  Besides, who wouldn't like an &lt;a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2005/02/8-hour-physical-exam-newsweek-writes.html"&gt;executive physical&lt;/a&gt;?  Expect this trend to increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it.  But before asking for that routine &lt;a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf/uspsacad.htm"&gt;stress echo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf/uspslung.htm"&gt;chest x-ray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf/uspsovar.htm"&gt;CA-125 test&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf/uspsblad.htm"&gt;urinalysis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/19/health/webmd/main1637144_page2.shtml"&gt;consider what you're getting yourself into&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The patient has no symptoms and doesn't smoke, but he gets a routine chest X-ray. If there is a small shadow, doctors are obligated to look further."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"That X-ray becomes a CT scan. That may show a small little nodule. The next thing you know, the patient ends up with a cardiothoracic surgeon who wants a needle biopsy, or even an open ," he says. "In a lot of these cases, he comes up with nothing, a benign nodule or something."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the costs in time and the potential for unnecessary suffering, these procedures add up to big money. Merenstein's modest estimate of the cost of just these three simple tests is $47 million to $194 million a year. And that doesn't include the cost of follow-up tests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>

<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,196260,00.html">No surprise to anyone reading this blog</a>.  BTW, it's good to see our <a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2004/05/evidence-based-medicine-up-for-trial.html">old friend</a> <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/gim/calendar/hmcjc_abstracts/JCJul04Article1.pdf">Dr. Merenstein</a> back in the news:<br/>
<blockquote>During your next routine medical checkup you have at least a 43 percent chance of undergoing an unnecessary medical test, a new study shows.<br/>
<br/>It's not like you're getting something for nothing. If you're not having symptoms, and your doctor has no reason to suspect you have a problem, U.S. guidelines advise against giving you a routine urinalysis, electrocardiogram, or X-ray.<br/>
<br/>"This has more harm than benefit," says Dan Merenstein, MD, director of research in family medicine at Georgetown University. "The problem is, there are so many false-positive results from these tests. They lead to other things, like biopsies.</blockquote>Another reminder that more testing does not equal better medicine.  I'll have more on this a bit later.</div>

<content mode="escaped" type="text/html" xml:base="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog" xml:space="preserve">No surprise about the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/20/business/20hyper.html?ex=1305777600&amp;en=504ab66d70e8c2e9&amp;amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;amp;emc=rss"&gt;pharmaceutical influence over prescribing practices&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;At a recent speech before another society, the American College of Cardiology, its new president, Dr. Steven E. Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, suggested that the medical profession had become addicted to industry money just as the nation was addicted to foreign oil.&lt;/blockquote&gt;There really should be no reason to treat hypertension with any brand-name drugs.  The exception is the need for a angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB), which does not have a generic yet.</content>

<blockquote>"If the battles you're fighting are being lost, then, to win the war, find battles that you can win," says David Brushwood, a professor of pharmacy health care administration at the University of Florida, Gainesville, and a critic of government narcotics policy. "Doctors are more conspicuous and easier to find than drug dealers, and, besides, they don't have guns and they don't shoot back."</blockquote>

<title mode="escaped" type="text/html">Another editorial sides with the AMA on the Studdert malpractice study</title>
<content mode="escaped" type="text/html" xml:base="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog" xml:space="preserve">&lt;a href="http://heraldnet.com/stories/06/05/19/100edi_editorial001.cfm"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt; in Washington:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Harvard researchers may not think the system is riddled with frivolous lawsuits, but we agree with the AMA that 40 percent is too many, and they do burden the system, even when there is no payout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps a penalty for filing a frivolous suit might help some patients have more respect for the law. Getting those numbers down would put the focus where it should be: punishing and/or weeding out the small percentage of doctors who harm patients.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Update - &lt;br /&gt;Here's another one.  The &lt;a href="http://www.pennlive.com/editorials/patriotnews/index.ssf?/base/opinion/1147990815238300.xml&amp;coll=1"&gt;Patriot-News&lt;/a&gt; in PA:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; In short, the medical malpractice system as we know it is one great big roulette wheel that does a far less than acceptable job of compensating those truly harmed by improper treatment. It survives, we suspect, because trial lawyers -- who appear to benefit from the system more than anyone else -- have convinced many Americans that any other system would fail to adequately compensate those who suffer serious injury as a result of medical error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, there's every reason to believe that an independent no-fault system run through special medical courts would do a far better job of awarding compensation to the truly deserving far faster, with far less uncertainty and personal trauma, and at far less cost. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>
