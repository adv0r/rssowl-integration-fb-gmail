            <link>http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/05/060524124401.htm</link>
            <description>Using one of the newest and most powerful tools of biomedical science, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) researchers have scored a dramatic success in the battle against colorectal cancer. The scientists were the first to use what are known as &quot;small interfering RNAs&quot; to block the spread of human colorectal cancer cells implanted in laboratory mice.</description>

            <description>Whether or not a fertilized mammalian egg ultimately develops into a male or female is determined by the winner of a tug of war between two different genes encoding signaling proteins and the divergent pathways they control, according to a new study led by Duke University Medical Center cell biologists.</description>

            <description>Listening to music can reduce chronic pain and depression by up to 25 per cent and make people feel more in control and less disabled by their condition. The people who took part in the study had suffered from painful conditions like osteoarthritis, disc problems and rheumatoid arthritis for an average of six and a half years.</description>

            <description>Chemists at Clemson University say they have developed a new type of quantum dot that is the first to be made from carbon. Like their metal-based counterparts, these nano-sized &quot;carbon dots&quot; glow brightly when exposed to light and show promise for a broad range of applications, including improved biological sensors, medical imaging devices and tiny light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the researchers say.</description>

            <description>An editorial accompanying a published debate on the pros and cons of starting treatment early in the course of multiple sclerosis comes down in favor of early treatment for this potentially devastating disease. This coincides with recommendations of the National MS Society, however, some clinicians disagree, choosing to defer treatment until the extent of disease activity is more clearly established. The April issue of the Archives of Neurology features both sides of this debate.</description>

            <title>Robotic Joystick Reveals How Brain Controls Movement</title>

            <description>By training a group of human subjects to operate a robot-controlled joystick, Johns Hopkins researchers have shown that the slower the brain &quot;learns&quot; to control certain muscle movements, the more likely it is to remember the lesson over the long haul. The results, the investigators say, could alter rehabilitation approaches for people who have lost motor abilities to brain injuries like strokes.</description>

            <title>How Ancient Whales Lost Their Legs, Got Sleek And Conquered The Oceans</title>

            <description>When ancient whales finally parted company with the last remnants of their legs about 35 million years ago, a relatively sudden genetic event may have crowned an eons-long shrinking process. An international group of scientists led by Hans Thewissen, Ph.D., a professor of anatomy at Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine, has used developmental data from contemporary spotted dolphins and fossils of ancient whales to try to pinpoint the genetic changes that could have caused whales, dolphins and porpoises to lose their hind limbs.</description>

            <description>Symptoms of bowel disorders like irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease can vary in function and severity.  New studies presented at Digestive Disease Week 2006 are finding that long-term therapy with new compounds can sustain relief for these patients with symptoms ranging from constipation to inflammation.</description>

            <description>MIT researchers are trying to unleash the promise of an old idea by converting light into electricity more efficiently than ever before. The research, which could have important applications in vehicles,  is applying new materials, new technologies and new ideas to radically improve an old concept -- thermophotovoltaic  conversion of light into electricity.</description>

            <description>A recent study has shown that immune signals given by variations of a single gene can trigger different immune responses and, when combined, are associated with increased severity of Crohn's Disease, particularly in Ashkenazi Jews.  The study is being presented at the annual meeting of the American Gastroenterological Association May 20-25 in Los Angeles.</description>

            <description>The number is staggering: Approximately 2 billion of the world's people -- nearly one-third of the human population -- have no access to electricity. 
One Florida State University researcher is working to break that cycle through the development of new energy technologies that are easy to install, environmentally sound and -- perhaps most importantly -- inexpensive to produce.</description>

            <title>Primate Center Research Suggests Multiple 'Body Clocks'</title>

            <description>Research conducted at Oregon Health &amp; Science University suggests that contrary to popular belief, the body has more than one &quot;body clock.&quot; The previously known master body clock resides in a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Researchers at OHSU's Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC) have now revealed the existence of a secondary clock-like mechanism associated with the adrenal gland. The research also suggests a high likelihood that additional clocks exist in the body.</description>
