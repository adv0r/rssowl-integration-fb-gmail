<title>Expect more backups in Pentagon security clearance</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060524/24natsec.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>There's no shortage of bad news for the Defense Department's problem-plagued security clearance program. Last month, it put a hold on processing new applications, blaming an overwhelming backlog of requests and a lack of funding. Then last week, the Government Accountability Office issued a tough report on the program, citing inexperienced investigators and communication problems between DOD and the Office of Personnel Management.</description>

<title>Kudos for Nancy Pelosi</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/baroneblog/archives/060524/kudos_for_nancy.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi deserves praise for depoliticizing the House ethics process. Yesterday Pelosi called for an ethics committee investigation of her Democratic colleague Rep. William Jefferson of Louisiana,  who has been accused of taking bribes. Some Republicans will be inclined to dismiss this on the grounds that she had little choice&#150;that it was an easy call. That's probably right. But I think it should be considered in light of the fact that after Alan Mollohan stepped down as ranking Democrat on the ethics committee&#151;a move that Pelosi or other Democratic leaders may well have urged on him&#151;Pelosi replaced him with her California colleague Howard Berman. Berman has served in that usually thankless position before. In my judgment, Berman is an absolute straight shooter who can be counted on to decide ethics issues on the facts and the rules, without regard to partisan fallout.</description>

<description>If you want to understand the disastrous decline of the New York Times in recent years, a good place to start is this National Review Online "Media Blog" post on a commencement speech given by Times publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. Stephen Spruiell of "Media Blog" links to the text of Sulzberger's speech, so you can read the whole thing if you want. What struck me about the quoted excerpts was their stupidity. This does not seem to be a very smart man. Example:</description>

<description>Sure, you can download hundreds of tunes into your iPod and play them on shuffle, but in the end, you're still going to be listening to songs you've already heard before. The promise of a new crop of hand-held satellite radio devices from Sirius and XM is that they let you tune in to dozens of channels of live music programming and can store hours of your favorite tunes, either downloaded from your collection or recorded directly from the radio broadcast.</description>

<title>Liberal Democrats take aim at Lieberman</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060523/23lieberman.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>If the Bush presidency and the war in Iraq have emboldened liberals to try to wrest control of Congress from Republicans this fall, they have also provoked the left to take on another foe: Democrats deemed too cozy with the GOP. And no such lawmaker is more high profile or higher ranking than Joe Lieberman. Now running for a fourth term, the Connecticut senator has been an unwavering supporter of the Iraq war. He was famously kissed on the cheek by Bush after last year's State of the Union address. "Lieberman has spent the last six years undermining the Democratic Party every chance he gets," says Markos Moulitsas, founder of Daily Kos, a popular liberal blog. "He spends the weekend going on Fox News and Sean Hannity's show talking about how wrong the Democrats are."</description>

<title>George McGovern on the unions</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/baroneblog/archives/060522/george_mcgovern.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>Former senator and 1972 Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern has written an interesting column for the Los Angeles Times on unions.  He argues that the traditional labor union strategy of always seeking, in John L. Lewis's word, "more," is self-defeating. He points to the Delphi bankruptcy, the woes of automakers General Motors and Ford, and the plight of the unionized airlines:</description>

<description>That's the theme of my column this week in U.S. News.  It's based on two reports, the International Monetary Fund showing record world economic growth and the Human Security Center of the University of British Columbia showing that armed conflict in the world is at record lows. Readers and viewers of mainstream media, peppered with woe-is-me economic news and footage of the latest bombing in Iraq, can be forgiven if they lose sight of the larger heartening trends. But we shouldn't forget them.</description>

<description>Here is a scenario that could be right out of a spy movie or the TV hit 24: A foreign intelligence service tells the CIA it has discovered that one of its nationals who is an active terrorist has made calls home from within the United States. The foreign spy service gives the CIA the man's aliases and the number he called from. Our counterterrorist agents leap into action. They ask the National Security Agency to check all the phone numbers the terrorist called in the United States or elsewhere to unmask a possible sleeper cell of other terrorists.</description>

<description>Over the years, financial adviser Richard Ferri has seen a few clients go to that great retirement community in the sky. And they have all left behind something: money. Lots of it. &quot;We've never had a client die with less money than they retired with,&quot; says Ferri, who works in Troy, Mich. &quot;If they retire with $2 million, they end up with $4 million. The value of the account goes up more than they anticipated, and they don't spend as much as they thought they were going to spend.&quot;</description>

<description>Does the White House have another &quot;Brownie&quot; problem brewing? That's how some critics view President Bush's choice of ServiceMaster executive Steven Preston as the next director of the Small Business Administration. Recall that after Hurricane Katrina, Bush got slammed when the public learned that the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Michael Brown, had a resume seemingly mismatched for the job--including a stint as rules enforcer for the International Arabian Horse Association. Preston's nomination last month also spurred misgivings. &quot;We don't need another unqualified SBA administrator,&quot; Lloyd Chapman, president of the American Small Business League and frequent Bush critic, said then.</description>

<title>Investors sour on tech titans like Dell, Intel, and Microsoft as they lose their growth-stock allure</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/articles/060529/29tech.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>Bad news has pounded steadily on the giants of personal computing as Dell, Intel, and Microsoft reported disappointing results in recent weeks. Each has made unique strategic and tactical errors and is scrambling to correct them. But their troubles point to a broader slowdown in PC sales, which enjoyed a three-year spurt but now appear to be decelerating again, perhaps to finally settle in as a mature market with growth rates more like those of the nation's overall economy. That the PC business is gradually slowing is not news. &quot;But it's maturing a lot faster than many people were expecting,&quot; says Roger Kay, a market analyst at Endpoint Technologies.</description>

<description>Things are better than you think. Yes, I know, most Americans are in a sour mood these days, convinced that the struggle in Iraq is an endless cycle of bloodshed, certain that our economy is in dismal shape, lamenting that the nation and the world are off on the wrong track. That's what polls tell us. But if we look at some other numbers, we'll find that we are living not in the worst of times but in something much closer to the best. What do I mean?</description>

<description>U.S. News obtained a copy of the draft strategic communications road map, dated May 18, 2006, which is expected to be signed by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in the coming weeks. It sets a tight schedule that reflects Rumsfeld's sense of urgency on this issue. The document lays out a series of deadlines to resolve disputes among the military's communications professionals and define policy that they will all follow.</description>

<title>The Pentagon's brand new plan for winning the battle of ideas against terrorists</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060529/29propaganda.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>Pentagon officials have just finished writing a document that they hope will help officials steer a path through contentious debates over how the military should handle communications, seen as central to the war on terrorism and, more generally, to the promotion of U.S. interests. The terrorists' increasingly savvy use of videos and the Internet to recruit followers and shape world opinion has given added urgency to the project. The document, called the &quot;strategic communications roadmap,&quot; a copy of which was obtained by U.S. News, has been through 10 drafts by senior officials; final approval is expected in the next few weeks.</description>

<description>CAIRO--Minni Minnawi wavered, agreed, and wavered again as the political heavyweights of three continents pressed him to sign the Darfur peace agreement. Sudan's government had blinked, negotiators told him, agreeing to provisions it had bitterly opposed. It was now up to Minnawi, leader of the rebel Sudan Liberation Army's biggest faction. The peace deal he signed May 5 may eventually stop the violence in Sudan's vast western region--but it came too late for Minnawi's brother, Yousaf, who was killed earlier that same day in South Darfur.</description>

But if there's a front line in the fight between American forces and insurgents, it runs straight through Ramadi's devastated downtown.</description>

<title>David Addington is the most powerful man you've never heard of. Here's why</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060529/29addington.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>One week after the September 11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush briefly turned his gaze away from the unfolding crisis to an important but far less pressing moment in the nation's history. The president signed legislation creating a          commission to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark Supreme Court ruling desegregating public schools. In a brief statement, Bush invited the various educational groups listed in the legislation to suggest the names of potential commissioners and also urged members of Congress to weigh in, as a &quot;matter of comity.&quot; But in a little-noted aside, Bush said that any such suggestions would be just that--because under the appointments clause of the Constitution, it was his job, and his alone, to make those kinds of decisions.</description>

<title>Presidents in a deep hole</title>

<description>George W. Bush doesn't consider himself a &quot;navel gazer,&quot; but lately he has been unusually contemplative. As he ponders his abysmal job-approval ratings and weakened presidency, Bush tells aides he is struck by the number of books being published about America's first president, ranging from David McCullough's bestselling 1776 to Joseph J. Ellis's His Excellency: George Washington. Two centuries from now, Bush has concluded, historians will still be assessing his own administration, and this has strengthened his resolve to take the &quot;long view,&quot; ignore today's growing army of naysayers and second-guessers, and do what feels right. &quot;The president is going to govern like it's his first day, not his last day, and really swing for the fences in terms of bold reform,&quot; White House counselor Dan Bartlett told U.S. News.</description>

<description>As Hurricane Katrina built up in the Atlantic last year, swept across Florida, then gathered force in the Gulf, many realized that this was the big one they had expected for years--yet when the storm struck, the country wasn't ready. Our political leadership had failed us. Even now, with a new storm season approaching, the Gulf region is still not ready.</description>

<title>Peter Beinart: Reviving the American left</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060529/29qa.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>Most Democrats these days eschew the &quot;liberal&quot; handle in favor of the less historically freighted &quot;progressive.&quot; Not           New Republic Editor at Large  Peter Beinart. In his book The Good Fight: Why Liberals--and Only Liberals--Can Win the War on Terror and Make America Great Again (HarperCollins), out next week, Beinart argues that the embattled American left can revive itself by proudly reclaiming the mantle of post-World War II liberalism. That's when mainstream liberals swore off Communist sympathizers, backed Democrats like Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy, and forged a Cold War strategy built on generous foreign aid and international cooperation. Now, Beinart says, liberals should use similar ideas to craft an alternative to the neoconservatives' plan for winning the war on terrorism. Until they do, he says, the United States will continue losing the fight against Islamic jihadism--and liberals will keep losing at the ballot box.</description>

<description>Ehud Olmert's first visit to Washington as Israel's prime minister may not produce dramatic announcements, but a lot will be riding on his private conversations with President Bush. Olmert will be presenting his concept of &quot;consolidation,&quot; which, if implemented, could lead to Israel's evacuating more than 60,000 settlers from 72 settlements and giving up Israeli claims to over 90 percent of the West Bank.</description>

<title>Hoffa grabbing headlines again</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060529/29week.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>For the record, as the cops like to say, FBI Case No.HQ9-60052, is still open. The feds never rest until they get their man, and that's true even if said man happens to be dead, which, in the above-cited case, is almost certainly true, that being the case of one James Riddle Hoffa. The G-men were at it again last week, poking holes in the ground in the unfortunately but--who knows--perhaps aptly named Hidden Dreams Farm northwest of Detroit. Thirty-one years after he toddled off to a lunch with two old mob lions and turned into one of the nation's most famous missing persons, Hoffa was grabbing headlines again. &quot;We do not leave any leads uncovered, obviously,&quot; a top FBI man said. Well, that's good to know. But at some point, one has to wonder about the wisdom of chasing back and forth across the country and spending untold taxpayer dollars looking for the corpse of the union warhorse. OK, sure, it's great history. This is the same guy, after all, whom Bobby Kennedy put in jail (fraud, jury tampering) and Richard Nixon let out (pardon).</description>

<title>Five flavors of PCs</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/articles/060522/22pcsales.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>No longer can PC makers simply tout faster and faster chips; current PCs already have more speed than users need. So marketing is getting more sophisticated, another sign that the PC business is maturing. An example is increasing segmentation&#151;different functions and pitches that target slices of the market. All industries go through it: Think toothpaste and dozens of flavors. Here are five examples of new PC flavors:</description>

<description>The stock market took it on the chin last week, with the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling around 300 points. This week, it's the housing market's turn to make news. Two key reports are due out that should shed light on the health of the residential real-estate market. Meanwhile, the federal government will update its estimate of first-quarter economic growth.</description>

<title>Memo to Colbert fans: Humor and edginess aren't the same</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/leoblog/archives/060517/memo_to_colbert_fans_humor_and.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>After comedian Stephen Colbert's anti-Bush routine at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, I suggested here that what he said that night was clever but not very funny.  The blog Boiling Mad criticized me over this, saying that &quot;Mr. Leo ignored the meat of Colbert's remarks. Read these excerpts ... and decide for yourself whether Colbert was edgy or not.&quot; Colbert surely was edgy (or, if you prefer, insulting, rude, bold, courageous, or taunting), but that didn't make his comments humorous.</description>

<description>While working stiffs suffered another real pay cut in 2005, it was another year of record-setting raises for America's CEOs. A Pearl Meyer &amp; Partners survey of large companies found the median CEO received a 10.3 percent raise last year to $8.4 million. And those at the top got packages that were truly jaw dropping. CEO William McGuire's accumulation of $1.6 billion worth of UnitedHealth Group's stock options was so huge and fortuitously timed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken an interest. And drivers around the country fumed when they learned that Exxon's retiring CEO Lee R. Raymond not only took home $49 million just for last year but also is now collecting a pension worth $98 million.</description>

<title>Karl Rove speaks at AEI</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/baroneblog/archives/060515/karl_rove_speak.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>I saw Karl Rove speak this morning at the American Enterprise Institute. The speech had been scheduled long before it was announced that George W. Bush would address the nation tonight on immigration, and Rove's prepared remarks were all about the economy. Here's a link to the video.  Rove started off by observing that when George W. Bush entered office the economy was in trouble, trouble that was compounded by economic losses of $100 billion and job losses of 1 million caused by the September 11 attacks. He argued that the Bush tax cuts strengthened the economy and produced new jobs&#151;more jobs than Europe and Japan put together. He noted that high-income taxpayers have been paying a higher percentage of total taxes and that revenues have been coming in far above forecasts&#150;$274 billion above in 2005, $137 billion above in the first half of fiscal 2006. Real disposable income is up 14 percent since 2001. When asked by a Senate Budget Committee staffer why median household income had declined in 2001&#150;04, he pointed to changes in household compositions, with more households headed by part-time and young workers.</description>

<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/buzz/archive/buzz060515.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>Last week, the Federal Reserve said future decisions on interest rate hikes would depend heavily on new economic data. Well, this week, a whole slew of new economic surveys is scheduled to be released, including three key reports on inflation. And several Fed officials, including Chairman Ben Bernanke, will be on the lecture tour this week. That should give the financial press ample opportunity to pepper them with questions about their true feelings on the economy.</description>

<title>Mortimer B. Zuckerman: Hypocrisy on stilts</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/articles/060522/22edit.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>The American public, not to speak of its elected officials, has been stunningly indifferent to our reckless fiscal course of the past five years. Maybe it's because our focus has been so much on terrorism, but the numbers are terrifying, too. President Bush inherited a budget surplus estimated at $5.6 trillion over 10 years. He has converted that giant plus into a giant minus--deficits estimated at $5 trillion over those same 10 years. Talk about a U-turn!</description>

<description>In the tradition of peaceful revolutionaries fed up with tyrants, the 49,000-member American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists unveiled a national prescription-writing campaign last week for the morning-after pill. What makes this group of physicians so irate, according to ACOG's past President Vivian Dickerson, is the &quot;despicable treatment of women at the hands of the FDA.&quot;</description>

<description>When a colleague showed up at work with a mammoth piece of pizza last year, Marion Nestle's first reaction wasn't to ask for a bite. Instead, she photographed the 2,000-calorie, 13&#189;-inch-long slice as yet another example of America's skewed relationship with food: ever on a quest for the next fad diet yet willing to gobble down grossly oversize portions. Nestle, a nutrition professor at New York University, has addressed food safety and food industry politics in previous books. In her latest, What to Eat, Nestle deconstructs the overwhelming array of products on the shelves of today's supermarkets and sheds some new light on their often-confusing nutritional claims.</description>

<description>At first, awareness dawns that you are struggling to follow conversations amid babble and noise. Soon &quot;your family and close friends joke about your getting deaf,&quot; says Joanne Pogue, 74, who as president of the library board in Washington, Maine, recalls finding it harder with each meeting to hear board members around the large table. &quot;I joked about it.&quot; Better, perhaps, than to be patronized (&quot;Uncle Jim, do you want me to listen to the specials and order for you?&quot;) or treated as barely there. Locked in growing silence, older people with impaired hearing often withdraw and grow isolated. Studies show they may even die before their time.</description>

<description>Normally, the annual meeting of Morgan Stanley follows the company script: Everybody congratulates one another on the wonderfulness of the venerable Wall Street firm, the few shareholders who bother to attend re-elect the directors, the meeting is adjourned, and it's time for lunch. But this spring's meeting was different. An upstart investor advice company with the forgettable name of Glass Lewis &amp; Co. had lambasted Morgan Stanley for excessive executive pay and told its clients, including the powerhouse New York State Common Retirement Fund, to support a proposal limiting future golden parachutes. To Morgan Stanley's shock, it passed with 55 percent of the vote.</description>

<description>Headlines from the CEO compensation wars: The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into charges that William McGuire, the chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group, backdated stock option grants to amass a fortune of $1.6 billion. Pfizer CEO Hank McKinnell collected a $16 million pay package last year and has racked up a $6.5 million annual pension, even though his company's stock has fallen about 9 percent a year during his five-year tenure at the helm. On top of his $15 million paycheck for 2005, General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt is pocketing $1 million more a year in dividends from shares he doesn't currently own and will receive only if he improves the company's lagging earnings.</description>

<description>Even after Enron's collapse wiped out her 20 years of savings, Jan Fleetham was slow to blame Ken Lay, the grandfatherly figure at the company's helm. Only months later did the Bloomington, Minn., retiree come to feel that the former chief executive, like the others at the top, should be held accountable. Fleetham died of lung cancer a few weeks after Lay's indictment and never lived to see him take the witness stand in the pivotal moment of one of the most important corporate criminal trials ever.</description>

<description>If you've taken a look at the national polls lately, you might decide an antidepressant is in order: Seventy percent of Americans say the country is headed in the wrong direction--the most pessimistic the public has been for the past 23 years. The president's popularity is at 29 percent, an all-time low; Congress's is even lower, on life support, at 23 percent. And last week's CBS News/New York Times poll didn't provide much of a vote of confidence for the next potential batch of national leaders, either: The highest favorable rating was at 34 percent, for Hillary Rodham Clinton--just 3 points ahead of President Bush. At least the president beat John Kerry--by a whopping 5 points.</description>

<title>New military rule book aims to prevent abuses</title>

<description>Earlier this month, congressional leaders were invited to a briefing with Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England. They were expecting a pre-release look at the long-awaited revision of the Army Field Manual guide to intelligence interrogations, one year after the Pentagon received a draft version from the Army Intelligence Center at Fort Huachuca, Ariz. These revisions--intended to provide clear rules to prevent the sorts of abuses that occurred at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq--have remained a secret so closely guarded that, according to one official, different grammatical versions of the manual were reportedly ordered drawn up to track any source of leaks to the media.</description>

<description>It's been hard to keep up with the scandal news on Capitol Hill. Last week, a former aide to Rep. Bob Ney who later went to work with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleaded guilty to conspiring to illegally influence Ney. A corporate executive pleaded guilty to bribing Rep. William Jefferson. And sources say a bribery investigation that's already ensnared Rep. Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham might well go much further.</description>

<title>Mike Hayden is smart, tough, a go-to guy. So why all the questions about him being the boss of the spook house?</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060522/22intell.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>For Gen. Michael Hayden, it was a daunting task--reforming a calcified bureaucracy stuck with a set of obsolete tools and techniques and increasingly unable to target the most urgent threats. Hayden's response: Inject a whole lot of new blood and technology into the place and open up an obsessively secret organization to the outside world. It sounds like today's CIA, but it was, in fact, the National Security Agency, the nation's enormous global eavesdropping and code-breaking bureaucracy. Hayden took over the place in 1999. Six years later, he had broken it of its sclerotic Cold War habits, made it more quick and nimble, refocused its attention on the dangerous places of the Middle East and Asia, and transformed it into a key player in the war on terrorism.</description>

<title>Much rests on whether Iran's leader is a shrewd nationalist or an end-times nut</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060522/22imam.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>At the bottom of a well in Jamkaran, Iran, lie tens of thousands of petitions addressed to a much-venerated figure in Shiite Islam called the 12th Imam. One recent addition to that pile would be of interest to the wider world. Written by the current president of Iran and signed by his entire cabinet, it might shed light on the mystical tendencies of a leader who has already succeeded in making an unstable region even more volatile, a man whom some are comparing to Hitler in his unbridled fanaticism.</description>

<title>The man in Tehran in his own words</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060522/22iran.b.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>It would require the patience of Job to respond to the litany of grievances that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent to George W. Bush last week--for litany is precisely what the rambling 18-page letter amounted to. Even an administration more inclined to diplomatic engagement than the Bush administration would be hard pressed to find hopeful openings for negotiation in this tangled, tortuous missive. It exudes the self-righteous piety and pseudo humility of a profoundly arrogant and ill-formed mind.</description>

<title>The United States and Iran are locked in a test of wills over Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Is there a way out short of war?</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060522/22iran.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>It's not the sort of letter an American president usually receives from a foreign leader. The missive last week from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to &quot;your excellency&quot; George W. Bush--the highest-level communication between Tehran and Washington in 27 years of official enmity--meanders over 18 pages of religious and philosophical terrain. But to western eyes it never got to the heart of the matter: Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iranian officials still called it a diplomatic &quot;opening&quot;; Bush dismissed it as so much piffle.</description>

<description>When pastor Ken Baugh announced he'd be devoting eight consecutive Sundays to analyzing The Da Vinci Code in the run-up to its film release, he knew some members of his Southern California megachurch would be skeptical. But Baugh also knew that many of his congregants had read the book and that many more would see the movie. &quot;Dan Brown did the church a favor,&quot; Baugh says. &quot;He forced people who call themselves followers of Christ to investigate what that really means.&quot;</description>

<description>Religious boycotts, literary lawsuits, even Tom Hanks's haircut. It seems there hasn't been a single element of           The Da Vinci Code that hasn't sparked some kind of controversy. And controversy, as Hollywood well knows, is a good thing. Mel Gibson's  The Passion of the Christrode a religious grudge match between Christians and Jews to cable-TV supremacy two years ago and a $600 million-plus box-office take worldwide. &quot;I say to our friends at the Vatican, 'Bring it on,'&quot; joked John Fithian, head of the National Association of Theatre Owners at a recent movie-industry conference.</description>

<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060522/22davinci.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>For the Rev. John Skirtich, the revelatory moment came on a Sunday morning late last fall. He had just concluded mass at St. Maurice Roman Catholic Church in Forest Hills, a tree-lined, middle-class suburb of Pittsburgh. One of his parishioners, an elderly woman, met him at the door, carrying a copy of The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown's phenomenally successful cloak-and-dagger novel, and she was visibly distraught.</description>

<description>As an orthopedic surgeon at the 86th Combat Support Hospital in Baghdad, Army Maj. Merritt Pember saw his mission as keeping grievously wounded soldiers alive until a medevac could fly them out for further treatment. Baghdad ER, a documentary that premieres on HBO on Sunday, May 21, details the experiences of Pember and his colleagues. U.S. News spoke with Pember, 33, now at Fort Hood, Texas.</description>

<title>In hell on Earth, a brief glimpse of hope</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060522/22week.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>Maps from antiquity used the Latin &quot;hic sunt leones&quot; to label the rough contours of the African continent: &quot;Here are lions.&quot; Some centuries later, even those in polite society, if they mentioned it at all, referred to Africa as &quot;the dark continent.&quot; Then, as now, the racial inference was an obvious one. But now, far more than then, with race having receded so much in the everyday calculus of so many around the world, &quot;dark&quot; conjures up more the sense of being out of sight and consciousness than of anything having to do with skin color. So it is that so much of the pain, squalor, and suffering that beset so many millions on the African continent regularly escapes the notice of so many millions of us in other places around the globe. AIDS, of course, remains on our radar screens. But of the tumult in places like Zimbabwe and Somalia--how many among us understand its causes, or care? Darfur occupies a special place in the continent's Dantean hell, and it has, only recently, managed to capture a flicker of the world's attention. For the record, it is a parched hell, in the far west of Sudan.</description>

As a teenager, he left George Washington University well shy of a political science degree to start his reporting career working for legendary muckraker Jack Anderson. And he's been ruffling official feathers since the Clinton Whitewater/Lewinsky imbroglio, when his stories on Salon.com took a prodigious swing at dismantling special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's $40 million investigation.</description>

<description>Among one of 30 questionable scenes in the Zapruder film, is the so-called sneaker problem. According to JFK assassination investigator Thomas Lipscomb, the two women shown in frame 299 of the Zapruder film were wearing black shoes. The Polaroids show then in the black shoes in pictures taken just before they walked to Dealey Plaza. But the women are shown in the film wearing white sneakers, says Lipscomb. He adds: "Remember, in the South, women never wore white shoes after Labor Day and it's almost December when this photo was taken in the Zapruder film."</description>

<title>Some wise thoughts on Iran</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/baroneblog/archives/060511/some_wise_thoug.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>Gerard Baker, in the Times of London, hashes over the question of whether the United States should respond to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's oddball letter by negotiating unilaterally with the Iranian regime. That's the course advocated by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and former National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. This much can be said for their argument: The likely downsides of military action against Iran are serious, not least the possibility of alienating the Iranian people, the large majority of whom currently seem opposed to the mullahs' regime; and a diplomatic agreement, if it could be reached, would be desirable. Against this view, it has to be said that the British, French, and Germans have been negotiating with Iran for several years, with no positive results at all. Albright and Berger don't give us much reason to believe that U.S.-Iran negotiations would be more productive; they just hope so.</description>

The bottom line seems to be that things are going better than mainstream media coverage would lead you to believe.</description>

<title>Democratic party philosophy</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/baroneblog/archives/060511/democratic_part.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>What should the Democratic Party stand for? It's not an easy question to answer. Forty years ago, it seemed natural for Democrats to stand for continuous expansion of the welfare state. Now that doesn't seem like such a good idea. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan proved that history doesn't always move left&#151;and shouldn't. Center-left leaders like Bill Clinton and Tony Blair have taken a different approach, with considerable political success; but they didn't seem to build lasting majorities for their parties. Clinton's successors as Democratic nominees won 48 percent of the popular vote&#151;close but no cigar. Blair's Labor Party is now running behind the Conservatives by 37 to 31 percent in the most recent British poll. That's not an indication that Labor can't win the next election, which is expected to be held in 2009. But it is an indication that it isn't carrying all before it, as it seemed to during Blair's first two terms, 1997&#150;2005.</description>

<title>The latest on Hawaiian sovereignty</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/baroneblog/archives/060511/the_latest_on_h.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>I can think of one good political side effect of Hurricane Katrina: It released Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist from his commitment to bring Sen. Daniel Akaka's Hawaiian sovereignty bill to the floor. This bill would define Native Hawaiians as a separate sovereign nation, giving them a status something like that of recognized Indian tribes. It seems to have gathered majority support in Congress. Senator Akaka is a nice man who has never asked his colleagues for much, and so some have been willing to give him their votes on this one. His Hawaii colleague, Daniel Inouye, first elected to the Senate in 1962, is a senior appropriator to whom many colleagues have become indebted over the years. The bill is strongly supported by Hawaii's Republican governor, Linda Lingle. It doesn't seem to affect any other state. Senator Akaka is being challenged in the Democratic primary by Congressman Ed Case. He surely wants to bring the bill up to give him a major accomplishment he can point to.</description>

My daughter is graduating from a top college prep private high school and did not get into any of her top three choices. She had a 3.5 GPA and a 1990 SAT score, took seven AP/honors classes, played two varsity sports, was captain of both teams and MVP, logged 300 hours of community service, and has been a leader in promoting diversity in small independent schools. </description>

<description>Do you ever dream of becoming an actor or a bed-and-breakfast owner? How about becoming a winemaker or a chocolatier, even if just for a day or two? Brian Kurth, a former director of product management at AT&amp;T and Ameritech, often daydreamed about other jobs he might rather do. "I didn't like the lifestyle, the commute. It's not that I hated my job or my boss, but I wasn't fulfilled either," Kurth says. It was then that he came up with the idea and registered the domain name for Vocation Vacations, a company that gives workers the chance to test the waters of exciting employment without quitting their day jobs.</description>

<description>So let's look around and see whom we can blame for rising gas prices. There's China, selfishly buying up oil for its own mushrooming fleet of cars, with no consideration at all for American drivers. Iran is burnishing its axis-of-evil credentials by making vague threats about destroying its economy and cutting off its own flow of oil to world markets. Hugo Ch&#225;vez&#8230;well, he's buddies with Castro. That's all anybody needs to know about him. Detroit has been forcing us to drive big gas guzzlers for years, and the nefarious oil companies just sit there and&#8230;make money!&#8230;as demand for their product outstrips supply.</description>

<title>Immigration</title>
<link>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/baroneblog/archives/060510/immigration.htm?s_cid=rss:site1</link>
<description>In Monday's Wall Street Journal, Joel Millman has an excellent piece of analysis headlined, "Work in Progress: Prosperity in Home Countries May Not Stem Tide of Migrants to the U.S." His point is that, for a time, economic growth in countries like Mexico and Brazil tends to produce more immigrants. That's because people with zero skills and zero experience of urban life are not likely to immigrate to an advanced country like the United States. People tend to immigrate when they have developed at least some rudimentary skills and have had some experience navigating the shoals of urban life&#151;and are attracted by the much higher wages offered in the advanced country.</description>

<title>What makes vibrant cities grow</title>

<description>I usually don't follow the links in E-mails from PR folks, but I did follow one to this two-month-old article in the New York Times Magazine on urban economics Prof. Edward Glaeser. It's larded with the usual left-wing pieties you expect in the NYT; the writer finds it hard to believe anyone would advocate getting rid of public housing and replacing it with housing vouchers, even though that's exactly what's been happening around the country for the past 30 years, to the benefit of all. But Glaeser turns out to be an interesting figure. He's against rebuilding most of New Orleans, which, as I have argued, is simply not going to be rebuilt whether or not we think it's a good idea.</description>
