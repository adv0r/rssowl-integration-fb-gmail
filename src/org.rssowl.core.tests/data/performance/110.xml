Ever feel like a "paying beta tester?" Ever think that manufacturers are just not listening to the customer? Ever wanted to jump ship and leave the Windows Mobile platform behind... but just couldn't?<br>I'm convinced that I'm in a love-hate relationship with Windows Mobile devices.

<title>LG PM80: T-DMB Pocket PC with... Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition?</title>
<link>http://www.pocketpcthoughts.com/index.php?action=expand,48898</link>
<description>
<![CDATA[
The LG PM80 Pocket PC ships with an Intel PXA270 312MHz processor, 64MB RAM, 64MB ROM, a 65K-colour QVGA (240 x 320) display, an SDIO/SD/MMC slot, T-DMB capabilities, and Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition. In my opinion, it has a great form factor, but apart from the T-DMB spec, it's riddled with outdated hardware (and an equally outdated version of the Windows Mobile platform). NATE.com has a review of the device posted, though it's in Korean...

"When a manufacturer takes styling cues from a number of popular devices -- in this case, the RAZR, the Wizard, and the gone-but-not-forgotten Clie -- and throws in a number of high end features whose acronyms make us a little weak-kneed, the resulting products are bound to be pretty sexy. Such is the case with a trio of WiBro-capable PDAs being marketed under the Flyvo brand by POSDATA, all of which run Windows CE 5.0 Professional Plus on an ARM...

"The target market for the G500 are users who want in-car navigation, Pocket PC and phone in one device.

I do not see the lack of Wi-Fi as major drawback since it can be added as add-on card. The only major drawback of the G500 as it...

It's with a great sense of frustration that tonight I implemented a robots.txt ban of the Mobipocket eNews Creator bot. If that doesn't work I'll be implementing an IP address block.

Adaptation Kit Updates, or AKU's, are updates to Windows Mobile 5. For the most part, it doesn't really matter to the end user or even developer what AKU level is on the device unless there is a specific fix implemented in a particular AKU, or in the case of WM5, AKU2 is significant because it contains the MSFP, or Messaging and Security Feature Pack, which is how HTTP push is enabled for email, plus a whole lot of other goodies. So, which AKU is...
