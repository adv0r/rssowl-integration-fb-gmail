      <link>http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117930565?categoryid=1010&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2582</link>
      <description>Book Reviews: Designed to showcase thesps in the act, this coffee-table tome serves up one arresting photo after another.

      <description>Book Reviews: Ava Gardner packed a lot of living -- and loving -- into her 67 years, and Lee Server seems hell bent on chronicling every dalliance in excruciating detail.
