<a href="http://eggbeater.typepad.com/shuna/2006/04/cheap_food_in_c.html">excellent response</a>
</strong> which garnered a lot of discussion via comments.<br/>
<blockquote>
<br/>Having the desire to earn a living so that one can pay others a living wage is not, by my standards, yuppification or gentrification.<br/>
<br/>Our privilege helps us to have unreasonable expectations. I have been working in restaurants for almost 15 years and I can count on one hand the amount of owners who run a decent business.</blockquote>

<a href="http://chockylit.blogspot.com/2006/05/vietnamese-coffee-cupcakes.html">Vietnamese Coffee Cupcakes</a>
</strong> that are inspiring even to this non-baker.<blockquote>When it comes to coffee flavored cakes, what one typically finds are mocha type concoctions (coffee and chocolate) or tiramisu type desserts (sponge or lady fingers doused in coffee). I haven't found many examples of coffee-flavored cake batter outside of these two options. In lieu of an existing recipe, my approach would be simple - substitute strong brewed coffee for the liquid in a basic cake batter.</blockquote>

<content mode="escaped" type="text/html" xml:base="http://www.kqed.org/weblog/food/" xml:space="preserve">&lt;img src="http://homepage.mac.com/amybsherman/images/eastwesteats.png"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bay Area is blessed with a fantastic variety of wonderful Asian food. With each wave of immigrants unfamiliar cuisines have made their way into our delicious community and become old friends. Some of the best restaurants and chefs in the Bay Area are cooking Asian food and some of them are coming together for the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aajasf.org/eastwesteats/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;East West Eats dinner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I talked with Charles Phan of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slanteddoor.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Slanted Door&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to get his thoughts about local Asian food and out what it's like to participate in this dinner along with chefs Robert Lam of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.butterflysf.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Butterfly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, Hung Le of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.threeseasonsrestaurant.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Three Seasons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, Peter Pahk of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.silveradoresort.com/html/dining.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;Silverado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, Kirk Webber of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cafekati.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Cafe Kati&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, Anjan and Emily Mitra of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://dosasf.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dosa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, Mutsumi Takhara of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slanteddoor.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Slanted Door&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and Chris Yeo of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.straitsrestaurants.com/TOPpages/4CriticalA.html" target="_blank"&gt;Straits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The East West Eats dinner takes place June 1st, register to attend by May 25th, &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aajasf.org/eastwesteats/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What trends are you seeing in Asian food in the Bay Area?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fusion has come and gone. I never really agreed with that anyway but I see more and more specialization. In the Chinese community people are doing more regional cuisines and are interested in Shanghai or Szechuan food etc. The whole school of regional cuisine is going to continue to grow--it's no different than like what A16 is doing making Neapolitan style food. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At my restaurant I'm taking old ideas and building them with local ingredients and sensibility--like cooking beef medium rare, same methodology same recipe but not medium well or using local vegetables but stir frying them the same way you would in Vietnam. Also using oysters and raw fish a Vietnamese style here we use fish sauce shallot and lime instead the Japanese style with wasabi. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's been the response to the cooking kits sold at Out the Door?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been great. The response has been phenomenal. We sold out super fast on Valentine's day. I was surprised! A lot of people had the idea to create a romantic dinner at home. People are using them in different ways than we expected such as for parties, romantic meals etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've held back but when we move to a central kitchen commissary there will be more choices. Maybe even "vlogs" video clips to learn how to cook with fresh ingredients all packed fresh daily. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are Western palettes adapting to Vietnamese cuisine or is Vietnamese cuisine adapting to Western palettes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combination of both. I'm surprised everyday at what people buy at the restaurant. At the same time a classic dish from Vietnam is never sold here, like Hainan chicken never sells, and I've tried a dozen times. Eating boiled chicken just won't catch on. But I'm doing a new dumpling that texturally is very unique and it is selling. People's tastes are changing rapidly, I sell lots of whole fish and people used to send it back everyday to have the head removed. I used to have fish returned every day now I haven't had one returned in over a year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What will the food be like at the East West Eats dinner?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The food is always better at these events than a sit down meal because it's prepared right there. Everybody is doing different things, everybody will showcase their speciality. It's a way for people to get to know the chefs. It's a good way to sample. You get to see several restaurants at one time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's it like working with the other chefs at an event like this?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do this all the time, you learn something new since most of us don't do catering, it's a challenge. I get to see my colleagues and give back to community. It's fun, mostly I wouldn't see these chefs except at these events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Want to know more about the East West Eats event?

<em>Place de la Concorde metro station in Paris</em>
<br/>
<br/>For those of you who have spent the past three years living with an indigenous tribe in sub-Saharan Africa, you might not have heard of <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thedavincicode/">
<strong>The DaVinci Code</strong>
</a>. For the other four billion plus of us, we have been inundated with Code media the likes of which have no doubt already seared their iconic status in future business school marketing classes. <br/>

<br/>
<em>Place de la Concorde metro station, before</em>
<br/>
<br/>The French who loathe anything splashy or frivolous (or garrulously American) actually redesigned the Concorde metro station a la DaVinci Code going so far as to repaint, yes repaint!, the station red! Considering they wouldn't so much as clean the metro stations when the Olympic bid committee came to town, this is quite a statement. So what does the DaVinci Code have to do with cooking, you ask? More than you might think, at least for this little cook.<br/>

<br/>
<em>Looking out to the gates from the chateau entrance</em>
<br/>
<br/>You might remember me mentioning now and again <a href="http://cucinatestarossa.blogs.com/weblog/2005/04/cracking_the_co.html">
<strong>a certain swanky chateau that I cooked at last summer</strong>
</a>? Well it was none other than the chateau featured in The DaVinci Code! Located about an hour northwest of Paris, the chateau is rented out to families for vacation, to ad agencies for photo shoots and commercials and yes, to movie studios for movies.<br/>
<br/>

</a>
<br/>
<em>Movie production trailers lined one side of the property</em>
<br/>
<br/>As it turns out, Dan Brown's wife stumbled upon the chateau and decided to use it in their unassuming little murder mystery... Who knew...?! The main character in the novel, Sophie Neveu played by Audrey Tautou, was named after a woman that lived in the chateau in the late 1700s, Sophie de Grouchy, who married the Marquis de Condorcet in the chateau's chapel. The best man at their wedding was none other than General Lafayette! Once again, who knew...?!<br/>

</a>
<br/>
<em>Plaque in the chateau chapel</em>
<br/>
<br/>At the chateau, I cooked for families that rented it for vacation and to call my schedule greuling would be an understatement, making cooking school seem like a walk in the proverbial park. I was up and in town by 7am getting fresh croissants and bread piping hot out of the oven from the local boulanger, then back to set the tables, prepare the fruit, and get the coffee going. Once breakfast was over, I started preparing lunch. After lunch wrapped up around 2 or 3pm, I'd head backing to town to purchase food for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.kqed.org/weblog/food/uploaded_images/dvc_night_chateau_300-740337.gif">

</a>
<br/>
<em>The chateau lit up and ready to go for the night filming</em>
<br/>
<br/>Once I returned to the chateau, I was frantically chopping, searing, roasting, boiling and more often than not burning until dinner. By the time dinner was prepared, served and cleaned up it was 10 or 11pm and then it was upstairs to plan the next days' meals and food shopping list. On a good day, I'd collapse in bed around 1am and do it all over again 6 hours later. <br/>
<br/>

</a>
<br/>
<em>The helicopter about to take aerial shots of the chateau</em>
<br/>
<br/>I was also there during the filming of the DaVinci Code movie and it was nothing short of breathtaking to see a blockbuster production kick into action. 300 people, 30-plus trailers, 1 helicopter and a week of filming all for just a few minutes of actual movie footage. How they created the lighting, the misty night air, the duplicate set of gates, the fog was stunning.<br/>
<br/>

</a>
<br/>
<em>Fake gates built over the real ones! They look identical down to the peeling paint.</em>
<br/>
<br/>The scene where Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) drove up to Teabing's chateau and spoke into the intercom garnered about 20 seconds of airtime but took no less than three hours to film as they had to film it at five different camera angles and each camera required up to five takes. The cool part of seeing the movie was having sat right behind the director while it was being filmed.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.kqed.org/weblog/food/uploaded_images/dvc_director_300_wide-726119.gif">
<img alt="The DaVinci Code Movie" border="0" src="http://www.kqed.org/weblog/food/uploaded_images/dvc_director_300_wide-722416.gif" style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;"/>
</a>
<br/>
<em>Sitting behind the director just before they yell out "Roulant!" (Rolling!)</em>
<br/>
<br/>There were three armoured cars, two Silas the Monk stunt doubles (a rather eerie site), and gallons upon gallons of coffee so everyone could stay awake. Since the action at the chateau took place at night they naturally had to film at night so set up began around 7pm and filming start at 11pm and ran til sun up. I'm not sure exactly what time everyone cleared out as I was usually asleep by 3am. There is just so many times you can watch someone repeat the same five lines into a fake intercom, even if it is the charming, gracious and very funny Tom Hanks....<br/>

<title mode="escaped" type="text/html">Local S%*!t Happens</title>
<content mode="escaped" type="text/html" xml:base="http://www.kqed.org/weblog/food/" xml:space="preserve">My &lt;B&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.grubreport.com/alacarte/applerant.html" target="_blank"&gt;computer curse strikes again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/B&gt;! A few weeks ago, I come back from a perfectly lovely dinner in Half Moon Bay, all full of good food and bonhomie and oh-so-ready to write a Bay Area Bites column about some rockin' &lt;B&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kqed.org/weblog/food/2006/05/unbearable-lightness-of-bean.jsp"&gt;Rancho Gordo Borlotti beans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/B&gt;...when my iBook decides to throw a tantrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now that the vein in my head has stopped jumping around in a thoroughly alarming manner, I can sit down and write about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a slight fantasy about putting a well-inked pen to clean white paper and composing long epistles about the glory of returning to the lost art of longhand-composed columns and pieces, but the unfamiliar sight of my own scrabbly handwriting scared me into a corner for a few hours where I also attempted to uncramp my confused fingers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about having a computer crisis in the Bay Area is that I could think of at least four people we could call for technical advice, and not one of them was CrAppleCare. NOT ONE! After brokenly calling my Bay Area Bites editor and leaving several tortured messages about my predicament, I called &lt;B&gt;&lt;a href="http://cookingwithamy.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Amy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/B&gt; to let her know I would be physically and mentally unable to make our appointment. Amy made sympathetic noises in my direction and suggested I give her incomparable husband, Lee, a call and pick his brain. I did, and The Incomparable Lee said calmly, "Okay, first thing is: Don't panic." Having just dragged myself through a sleepless night where I was up every two hours, checking on how my disk utility was coming and creeling, &lt;B&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/story.cgi?show=112&amp;story=9292&amp;limit=&amp;sort=" target="_blank"&gt;"The O.C.!"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/B&gt; and &lt;B&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/story.cgi?show=162&amp;story=9305&amp;limit=&amp;sort=" target="_blank"&gt;"Grey's Anatomy!"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/B&gt; to myself, I didn't have the heart or sense of humor to ask The Incomparable Lee if &lt;B&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy" target="_blank"&gt;a towel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/B&gt; would be of any good use in this situation. The Incomparable Lee talked me through the problem, provided much sound advice and information, and really helped to assuage my stomach-twisting fears that I had lost nine months of unbacked-up data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after all that, I ended up stress food shopping at Albertsons when my sole intention had been to pick up a prescription and some cotton balls. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's some news for a few of you out there: Cheetos aren't local. And when it comes right down to it, neither are caramel-filled Hershey Kisses. But both are damn tasty in almost every situation and they come off especially tasty when contemplating missed deadlines, unrecoverable photographs, and nine months of deleted work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I'm sorry &lt;B&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eatlocalchallenge.com" target="_blank"&gt;Eat Local&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/B&gt;. I'm still trying.</content>

What are "modern Asian flavors" and "a taste of Shanghai" all about?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I've cooked my family's recipes for my friends and people really like the Shanghainese flavors. Shanghai was a true melting pot, with Europeans, Americans, Indians, so the flavor is much more European style. The flavors are in the sauces that come from a specific dish. In modern Asian cuisine, if you don't want to cook Chinese you don't have to, use the flavors and sauces anyway you like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Why did you decide to share your Chinablue recipes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to take Shanghainese flavor profiles and bring them into American households. People don't cook anymore, they prepare, mostly the recipe are for dishes anyone can make. The sauces in the book aren't &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; the same as the ones from Chinablue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. How does Shanghai cuisine compare to other styles of Chinese food?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things, there's a sweetness to everything, it's a cleaner type of cuisine not using heavy sauces like hoisin, a complexity to the flavor that is never overbearing.  Enhancing a dish but never overpowering it. More of a "dish" from a visual perception. When you're eating shrimp, you're eating shrimp, there isn't too much else in the dish. It's not the country style "one-pot" type of stir-fry. It's much more refined, sophisticated for the wealthier city people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Other than your house, where can people find great Shanghainese food in San Francisco?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shanghai1930.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Shanghai 1930&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is good, if a little diluted, I ate at &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/XUK7nqudE8O3FRV1Amg69Q" target="_blank"&gt;Old Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on Geary with my mom and it was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. You left Shanghai when you were still a child, what is it like today?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's like San Francisco, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago all in one city and growing ten times faster. It's becoming the gateway to culture like Paris or New York.</content>

<br/>A movement is afoot in Washington that has many bloggers concerned.  Referred to as "net neutrality," the discussion involves the most fair way to offer content to consumers:  do we allow equal access to network bandwidth, or do we allow the network to be sold to the highest bidder resulting in "fast sites" that pay more money and "slow sites" that do not?<br/>
<br/>Under the latter scenario, blogs hosted by large companies would be much faster than <strong>

<blockquote>Since about the 17th century, there's been a strong sense that basic transport networks should serve the public interest without discrimination.This might be because so much depends on them: They catalyze entire industries, meaning that gratuitous discrimination can have ripple effects across the nation. By this logic, so long as you think the Internet is more like a highway than a fried-chicken outlet, it should be neutral in what it carries.</blockquote>

<blockquote>One of the Internet's great strengths is that a single blogger or a small political group can inexpensively create a Web page that is just as accessible to the world as Microsoft's home page. But this democratic Internet would be in danger if the companies that deliver Internet service changed the rules so that Web sites that pay them money would be easily accessible, while little-guy sites would be harder to access, and slower to navigate. Providers could also block access to sites they do not like.</blockquote>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I had never been to Cha-Ya, the much-vaunted vegan Japanese restaurant in North Berkeley. But this week, in a valiant effort to put as much pickled burdock in my mouth as possible, I tried not only the Berkeley Cha-Ya, but the new San Francisco outpost, too. The things I do for you.<br/>
<br/>Regulars to the Berkeley restaurant should chime in, because I fear that my friend Shree and I took a misstep in ordering. I'd like to know what we did wrong, because the reality just did not live up to the hype. (And, that's right, no photos. Bad blogger! Blame the broken camera -- and check out <a href="http://sfcityeats.blogspot.com/">
<b>Rae's</b>
</a> <a href="http://sfcityeats.blogspot.com/2006/02/cha-ya-vegetarian-japanese-restaurant.html">
<b>lovely photos</b>
</a>.)<br/>
<br/>As we expected, we waited a loooong time for a table. The Berkeley Cha-Ya is notorious for the long wait. It was a nice evening, and it gave us plenty of time to look over the menu, which we did not do, because we were busy catching up. The space is very small, and, as I said, very popular. We probably waited about 40 minutes (and, at the end of our meal, were shooed out to make way for others patiently waiting). <br/>
<br/>The menu is a little confusing. It's amazing how many permutations of vegetables, rice, and noodles there can be. We started with haru maki ($6) -- vegetarian (natch) spring rolls, lightly fried. They had asparagus, shiitake, carrots, beans, tofu, and silver noodles, all wrapped up nice and tight in a lightly fried package. Slightly greasy, served with a sweet dipping sauce. The vegetables seemed too soft -- I like my vegetables to bite back a little, you know, and these just gave in rather easily. Put up a fight, dammit. <br/>
<br/>Shree then had the taku-sui ($7.75), a big bowl of pot stickers and vegetables in broth. This was the big disappointment. It fell prey to the vegetarian stereotype (to which I generally do not subscribe): bland, cabbagey, boring. The potstickers tasted like they came from Trader Joe's, which I highly doubt, but still. <br/>
<br/>I had the hana gomoku ($8.50), which seemed like a vegetarian version of chirashi sushi: sushi rice in a bowl topped with artfully displayed vegetables. Plenty of good hijiki mixed in with the rice, and a nice helping of pickled ginger to fire up the tastebuds. Again, I could have used a little more toothsomeness in the vegetables, but it was clean-tasting and fresh. <br/>
<br/>Shree, needing a little palate pick-me-up after her bland bowl of taku-sui, suggested we order a roll, specifically the umekyu ($3.95). It was the perfect ending (though perhaps should have been the beginning) -- the bitter-bright flavor of pickled plum and the cool cucumber put us in better spirits. And I was ready to face the next Cha-Ya.<br/>
<br/>It was two days later, actually. The San Francisco Cha-Ya (762 Valencia, next to New College) can't be missed. In a rather odd contrast to its mellow Berkeley sister, SF Cha-Ya glows like a fluorescent beacon. The lighting is horrible, as Tablehopper has <a href="http://www.tablehopper.com/2006/04/fresh-meat-cha-ya.html">
<b>reported</b>
</a>. But perhaps fluorescence greases the wheels: we walked in at 7:30 and got seated immediately. The SF outpost is bigger than its Berkeley sibling, and maybe word has not yet spread enough to make for long waits. <br/>
<br/>The SF menu is exactly the same. They even left the sake and beer on the menu -- despite the fact that they do not yet have a liquor license. You can plan your booze for future visits. Kara and I shared a few dishes, and while the overall impression of the food was better, the ambience needs a little work. It's like a doctor's office in there. <br/>
<br/>We had the goma ae ($5.75) -- blanched spinach and broccolini with a flavorful sesame dressing. The spinach was shaped into a pleasing spinach log, which did not mask the fact that it was plain blanched spinach. Thank god for the dressing -- pleasantly oily and thick. We then branched into tempura sushi, sharing the vegetable tempura roll (squash, carrots, yam, and green beans, tempura'd as a whole and then wrapped in rice and nori, $6.75) and the Shattuck roll (tempura'd asparagus and yam, $6.75). The tempura batter was not too thick, not too greasy, and offered a nice crunch. The rolls were definitely the high point. We also had the kinoko soba ($8.50) -- a medley of mushrooms and soba noodles in a light broth. <br/>
<br/>It was plenty of food -- I don't think we finished it all. Overall, I was surprised at how lackluster both restaurants were. Good for vegetarians, yes -- as Shree said, she was happy that she could walk in knowing that she could order absolutely everything on the menu. But everyone knows by know that sacrificing meat (figuratively) doesn't mean sacrificing flavor, and Cha-Ya's glowing reputation wasn't clearly defended. I know others feel differently, and I would certainly be willing to give it more chances -- there's certainly plenty more to try on the menu.<br/>
