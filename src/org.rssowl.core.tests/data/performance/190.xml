However, the U.S. National TABLE Soccer Team, whose players have captured a combined total of well over 20 World and 100 Major tour titles, is widely expected to dominate the World Cup &#8211; of &quot;Foosball.&quot; Yes, you read that right: foosball, a.k.a. &#8220;table soccer.&#8221; You know, that game with miniature soccer men attached to rods that spin around to hit a little ball on a kitchen table sized soccer field. As it turns out there&#8217;s much more to it than that, and you&#8217;ll be able to see for yourself May 25-28, 2006 at the famed Fischauktionshalle in Hamburg, Germany, where about 200 of the world&#8217;s most elite foosball players will compete for the International Table Soccer Federation (ITSF) World Cup title.
