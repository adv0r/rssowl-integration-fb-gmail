      ZDNet &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1040_22-6076351.html&quot;&gt;looks at the latest OLPC prototype&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;&lt;span&gt;Other details about progress on the systems appeared on the OLPC site over the weekend. For instance, a team from Linux vendor Red Hat has trimmed the software distribution from 400MB to about 250MB, uncompressed. 'There is still low-hanging fruit left to pull out of the image, including bitmap fonts we don't use (7MB), the X font server (1MB) and Perl (30MB),' the site says.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;

      Groklaw has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060524112209579&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman's article&lt;/a&gt; about the change in Java licensing.  &quot;&lt;span&gt;Why did this non-incident generate a large and confused reaction? Perhaps because people do not read these announcements carefully. Ever since the term 'open source' was coined, we have seen companies find ways to use it and their product name in the same sentence. (They don't seem to do this with 'free software', though they could if they wanted to.) The careless reader may note the two terms in proximity and falsely assume that one talks about the other.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;

All tools are now fully functional with most menu options and some galleries
also completed. Xara recently passed build number 1000, representing more
than 1000 patches, submissions and fixes to the public code repository.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;

      FFII has sent out a press release on a seemingly obscure (but important)
ruling by the European Commission.  &quot;&lt;span&gt;In a reply to a question from Polish MEP and  
inventor Adam Gierek, the European Commission has confirmed that the  
European Patent Office's (EPO) case law is not binding for member  
states, nor (under the proposed Community Patent regulation) for the  
European Court of Justice (ECJ). For the first time, the Commission  
has also clearly stated that computer programs are not patentable  
subject matter, without hiding behind the infamous 'as such'
cop-out.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;

      The first alpha release of the Dirac codec - a free, high-quality video
codec developed by the BBC - is available.  &quot;&lt;span&gt;Be aware that the files
created by the encoder is not 100% valid Dirac 
files so any files created at this point might not work with future
versions of the decoder or with other decoder implementations like the 
C++ one from the BBC. Be also aware that performance is slow at this
point as very little optimization work is done so only high performance
computers will be able to playback created files smoothly.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;  The
codec is licensed under the MPL, the GPL, the LGPL, and the MIT license, so
there should be a satisfactory choice for almost anybody.

The long-awaited GnuCash 2.0 release is near.  Your editor, whose desperate
attempts to balance the family budget are made on a system running the
Fedora development tree, got a rather unplanned opportunity to try out 
GnuCash&amp;nbsp;1.9 (the pre-2.0 test release) when the Fedora hackers quietly slipped
it in as a replacement for the stable version.  A few months of financial
firefighting later, it's time for a quick review.

the Free Software Foundation (FSF), Defective By Design is urging all
technologists to get involved at the start of the campaign. &quot;Technologists
are very aware of the dangers of DRM,&quot; said Peter Brown, Executive Director

      The PostgreSQL team has put out a set of &quot;urgent updates&quot; closing a
newly-discovered set of SQL injection issues.  Details about the problem
can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.postgresql.org/docs/techdocs.50&quot;&gt;the
technical information page&lt;/a&gt;; in short: multi-byte encodings can be used
to defeat normal string sanitizing techniques.  The update fixes one problem
related to invalid multi-byte characters, but punts on another by simply
disallowing the old, unsafe technique of escaping single quotes with a
backslash.
