			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently on the internets there was a debate about whether or not it was proper feminist protocol to pop open a site called <a href="http://gofugyourself.typepad.com/">Go Fug Yourself</a> and cackle mercilessly at the parade of horrid celebrity clothing that the proprieters mock. <a href="http://feministlawprofs.law.sc.edu/?p=103"> Ann Bartow said no</a>; <a href="http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2006/03/hell_yes_go_fug_1.html">Lindsay said yes</a>. At the heart of the debate is not whether you can tell at first blush whether or not making fun of stupid clothes is sexist so much as whether or not or it&#8217;s appropriate to laugh at female fashion victims . Are rich fashion victims also victims of the patriarchy? Do we owe them our pity?</p>
<p>Since then there&#8217;s been a few interesting posts on this sort of subject.  <a href="http://pandagon.net/2006/05/18/defending-paris/">Jedmunds linked to a defense of Paris Hilton</a>.   <a href="http://blog.pulpculture.org/2006/05/22/pink-and-turning-off-that-pop-culture-tape-in-your-head/">Bitch Lab posted on a debate </a>over whether or not it&#8217;s cool that Pink has a video mocking other women for being shallow idiots. To no one&#8217;s great surprise, I&#8217;m going to weigh in on this debate on the side of ruthless mockery. Not only am I going to approve mocking &#8220;stupid girls&#8221;, celebrity fashion victims and socialites who are famous for being giant assholes, but I&#8217;ll say such humor is a valuable component of a sustainable model of patriarchy-blaming.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s silly to waste time trying to label individuals as Victims or Not Victims of the patriarchy&#8211;it&#8217;s perfectly possible for a person to be both victim and oppressor. The guy who has to suffer the humiliation at the hands of the male pecking order at work only to go home and beat his wife is an example of this. <a href="http://kakamak.blogspot.com/2006/05/i-like-paris-hilton.html">Not that this means that I think the defense of Paris Hilton was wrong</a>&#8211;I don&#8217;t doubt Paris does feel pressure to dress and act a certain way, etc.&#8211;but it does well to remember that she&#8217;s a huge asshole and a self-appointed judge of other women&#8217;s worthiness as sexual playthings, and for this she should be mocked ruthlessly. <a href="http://gofugyourself.typepad.com/go_fug_yourself/2006/05/brandon_fuggis.html">This recent post from Go Fug Yourself where Heather attacked Brandon Davis and Paris Hilton</a> making fun of Lindsay Lohan is just the sort of humor that makes this feminist cackle.  (<a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2006/05/oh_no_you_didnt.html">Hat tip, Ezra</a>.)</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s well-documented by now what Brandon Davis was filmed saying about Lindsay Lohan &#8212; lengthy and numerous rants disparaging her private parts and their cleanliness, announcing that he is disgusted with how poor she is because she is only worth $7 million, and spitting that he would never, ever sleep with her, before asking the videographer, &#8220;Would YOU [sleep with] her?&#8221; All the while Paris Hilton is choking on her own laughter, because there&#8217;s nothing at all trashy about her.</p></blockquote>
<p>So fuck Paris Hilton for being a shallow turd, too stupid to be aware that if she wasn&#8217;t born into wealth, she&#8217;s have died off by the time she was 10 years old from sheer stupidity. Mocking her for this is a wholesome activity that should be encouraged. Mockery is an excellent way for people to convey their values systems and progressives shouldn&#8217;t cripple ourselves by abandoning this tool. Just as mocking someone&#8217;s race encourages racist values, mocking someone for being racist encourages anti-racist values. When you mock Paris Hilton for being the sort of trash who thinks making fun of a woman&#8217;s (probably throughly scrubbed and waxed) genitalia, you are discouraging people from being this kind of trash.</p>
<p>Not that I necessarily blame people for being skittish about this sort of thing.  <a href="http://faultline.org/index.php/site/comments/shame_on_you_alex/">There is an epidemic of people who can&#8217;t quite grasp how to make fun of someone else</a>. For instance, it&#8217;s difficult for people to understand that just because Michelle Malkin is an odious person doesn&#8217;t mean she&#8217;s a good target for racist insults. There&#8217;s one very simple rule when determining how to make fun of someone:</p>
<p><strong>Mock the thing that is odious about them, not something innocous.</strong></p>
<p>Simple. There is nothing wrong with having Asian heritage, but there is something wrong about being a racist twit. When mocking Malkin, mock her racist twittery. Alternately, what&#8217;s funny about Paris Hilton is not that she has sex nor that she filmed it; what is funny is that she answered her cell phone in the middle of the filmed sexual encounter, indicating what her investment in the situation was. Especially funny is the way her partner chased her around the bed trying to get her to hold still, indicating a lack of dignity on his part.</p>
<p>And mocking the parade of horrible clothes that celebrities wear might not be your thing, but it&#8217;s a perfectly feminist activity in that it functions as a critique of the very existence of fashion victimhood. The fashion industry is showing nothing but contempt for women when they churn out clothes designed to make women look stupid or clownish and when we meet their contempt with derisive laughter, we are fighting back.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paula Zahn had infamous &#8220;ex-gay therapist&#8221; (or as he calls himself, &#8220;conversion therapist&#8221;)  <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cohen_(therapist)">Richard Cohen</a></strong> on last night in a segment called &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/23/pzn.01.html">New Therapy Claims to &#8220;Cure&#8221; Homosexuality</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CNN correspondent on the piece is Deborah Feyerick.</p>
<blockquote><p>Richard Cohen, now married with three kids, is a leader in the so-called reparative therapy movement. With just more than 1,000 members it is not a particularly big movement, but because it&#8217;s so controversial and despised within the gay community it tends to get a lot of attention.</p>
<p>&#8230;FEYERICK (voice-over): Cohen, who had several boyfriends, spent years in various kinds of therapy searching for answers. It wasn&#8217;t until he remembered being sexually abused by a man when he was a child that what he calls his convergence process began,</p>
<p>COHEN: I knew it wasn&#8217;t for me. I knew it in my gut I wasn&#8217;t born this way.</p>
<p>FEYERICK: <strong>Cohen is an unlicensed therapist</strong>. He offers the theory that some kind of childhood trauma triggers homosexuality. All it takes is figuring out what it is, healing from it and moving on. One of his clients is a 42 year old program analyst who we&#8217;ll call Rob. Because it is such a sensitive subject, he asked us to shield his identity.</p>
<p>He began seeing Cohen three years ago after years of struggling with unwanted homosexual feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;ROB&#8221;, CONVERSION THERAPY CLIENT: I had a mother that basically committed emotional incest with me because they had a very bad marriage. She used me as her husband, a stand-in.</p>
<p>FEYERICK: Cohen explains Rob&#8217;s same-sex attraction is typical of the men he treats. Cold, distant dad, overbearing mom and overly sensitive kid. <strong>He showed us some of his unconventional techniques like touch therapy, in which he encouraging Rob to seek out same-sex mentors to basically re-create a healthy father-son bond</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The transcript doesn&#8217;t describe what Cohen does next on the video to demonstrate his therapeutic &#8220;techniques.&#8221; I&#8217;ll let Steve @ <a target="_blank" href="http://atb.opho.org/atb/?p=52">A Tenable Belief</a>, describe what he saw.</p>
<blockquote><p>He sits upright on a sofa, his client<strong> sprawls lengthwise for a close chest-to-chest embrace</strong>. The reporter does a sanity-check, asking the client if he feels aroused. Nope, just safe.</p>
<p>Cohen, saying that another key technique is designed to release memories embedded deeply in one&#8217;s muscles, raises a tennis racquet above his head and bashes a pillow once for each word he screams at his mother.</p>
<p>Wow.</p></blockquote>
<p>What, exactly, is Richard doing with his clients (and they are almost all men&#8230;hmmm)? The reporter didn&#8217;t ask whether Cohen was aroused.</p>
<p>By the way, Cohen calls that pillow/tennis racket technique <em><strong>bioenergetics</strong></em>. Do you beat the gay away?</p>
<p><a id="more-2959"></a></p>
<p>Wayne Besen, author of the eye-opening book about &#8220;ex gay&#8221; movement, <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.anythingbutstraight.com/">Anything But Straight</a></em>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.waynebesen.com/2005/01/pfox-leader-richard-cohen-expelled_25.html">reported last year</a> that <strong>Richard Cohen</strong>, also president of Parents and Friends of ExGays and Gays (<a href="http://www.pfox.org/">P-FOX</a>), was  &#8220;expelled for life&#8221; out of the American Counseling Association for malpractice and unethical conduct. You have to read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.waynebesen.com/2005/09/ex-gay-has-meltdown-after-tv-debate.html">Wayne&#8217;s post</a> about an unhinged mailing Cohen sent out after he and Wayne debated on a NJ television program.</p>
<p>Cohen also wrote <em>Coming Out Straight: Understanding and Healing Homosexuality</em> (with a forward by Dr. Laura, no less!). Where he elaborates on the &#8220;causes&#8221; of The Gay. Read and weep from this BS up at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.narth.com/docs/comingoutstraight.html">NARTH site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>He lists the factors that predispose a person to homosexuality: &#8220;heredity, temperament, hetero-emotional wounds, homo-emotional wounds, sibling wounds/family dynamics, body-image wounds, sexual abuse, social or peer wounds, cultural wounds, and other factors: divorce/death/ intrauterine experiences /adoption/ religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;Cohen is a second-generation reparative therapist who is as zealous about helping others find and facilitate healing as he was zealous to find healing for himself. Unlike the concepts used by first-generation reparative therapists who were trained largely in the psychoanalytic tradition, many of Cohen&#8217;s concepts and recommended techniques appear to reflect the influences of family systems therapy, the recovery movement, faith healing, and the holistic health movement in mental health and pastoral counseling.</p>
<p>Therapists more versed in psychoanalysis and traditional Reparative Therapy may find it challenging to translate some of Cohen&#8217;s ideas and language, such as the &#8220;adult-child&#8221; and &#8220;inner-child,&#8221; and what he describes as the need to &#8220;balance both light and dark energies&#8221; through fun and play into concepts with which they more familiar.</p>
<p>&#8230;Cohen acknowledges that it is more important to understand the process of recovery, as well as the causes and meaning of same-sex attractions, than to use any given technique. The &#8220;tools and techniques to be used in each stage of recovery may change,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but the tasks will remain the same&#8221; in overcoming what he clearly sees as a &#8220;developmental disorder.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This man is dangerous.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now, I&#8217;m sure most of you have seen this image.</p>
<p><img style="width: 475px; height: 315px" src="http://rogouski.com/albums/battlecry-1/31_G.jpg" /></p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t, check out <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20060513_battlecry_philadelphia/">this article about Battlecry Philadelphia</a>, a gathering of 17,000 kids from 2,000 churches to reenact a Nazi Youth rally without the sex or the knowledge of what they&#8217;re doing. In other words, they&#8217;re complete suckers. The only reason to attend a fascist hootenanny is for the orgiastic potential, though I recommend putting the diaphram in beforehand because they appear to look askance at any woman caught exercising a reproductive right or two.</p>
<p><a id="more-2958"></a><img width="315" height="475" src="http://rogouski.com/albums/battlecry-1/7_G.jpg" /></p>
<p>I wish I could offer some insight into why it is that the fundie Christians are getting so damn fascist now. Blaming 9/11 is too simplistic, since it wasn&#8217;t exactly an attack on any of the right wing &#8220;values&#8221; that energize the base, like misogyny, homophobia, white supremacy, or Christian identity. Al Qaeda went after NYC, and therefore after the real enemies of the Christian right&#8211;worldliness and social liberalism.</p>
<p>The ugly truth is something deeper and more complex, I think. The truth is that it doesn&#8217;t take as much for people to slide towards fascism as we&#8217;d like to think.  The ingredients are a population that feels disempowered, a leadership willing to provide them scapegoats in order to consolidate power and a some rhetoric about how they are the true stewards of history.  The major thing that&#8217;s salvaging our country from a takeover by the mindset we&#8217;re seeing here is that most Americans don&#8217;t actually feel as emasculated and out of power as the handful agitating for a more fascist America seem to feel.</p>
<p>Still, I&#8217;m not feeling very optimistic tonight.  <a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2006/05/southwestern-strategy.html">The English language amendment is</a> exactly the sort of thing that gives us fascism-watchers a cold chill.  The bill exists for no other reason than to bolster the egos of those in our nation who get off on feeling superior to others, who like watching others be dehumanized.  Passing laws that only exist to separate the Overman from the Vermin is a sure sign that this country has completely lost its way.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://fengi.livejournal.com/518820.html">Reader fengi</a> sent me this article from the Chicago Tribune raising the alarm about teenagers who <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/q/chi-0605210442may21,1,3319342.story?page=1">not only use the dreaded MySpace* but they use it to talk about emo</a>. While I sympathize with parents that are concerned about their kids enjoying emo, I think my reasons are entirely different than the ones this article suggests should be the causes of concern.**</p>
<blockquote><p>Now emo is a subculture with a dress and drama all its own. According to kids, teachers, and therapists in Chicago and the suburbs, it has become the latest cool thing in junior highs, where cool is everything.</p>
<p>Only some grown-ups and even older emo kids themselves worry that young teens and preteens might be in over their heads in a scene that&#8217;s wrought with self-injury, prescription swapping and long hours venting their dark side on blogs that they forget can be read by anyone.</p></blockquote>
<p>If kids are actually cutting, that is cause for concern, but color me skeptical. Am I the only person who remembers actually being a teenager? For those who don&#8217;t remember, in the teenage years when your brain is soft and mushy, morbid and highly dramatic things have great appeal. I was a fan of horror novels (and still a fan of horror movies). The Goth culture shows no signs of disappearing, especially since it&#8217;s a handy way for kids of uptight Christians to scare the ever-living shit out of them.</p>
<p>Emo is even more boring than Goth, but if you only knew about it from this article, you&#8217;d think it was a non-stop party, despite the moping.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When I was in high school, kids crushed up Ritalin, Adderall, you name it. The emo kids were poppin&#8217; pills, doin&#8217; it all,&#8221; said an 18-year-old from Hoffman Estates, who kept a keen eye on the scene and worries that what is now almost a joke among college kids has snared serious attention from 7th graders.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a generation marked by promiscuity and disobedience under wraps,&#8221; he said of his peers. &#8220;It&#8217;s like the hair in front of their eyes shields the world from seeing the moral breakdown. Under the gentle swoop of the bangs lies a world of debauchery.</p></blockquote>
<p><a id="more-2952"></a></p>
<p>Strip away the colorful language and what you&#8217;re left with is the argument, perhaps familiar to anyone who&#8217;s been alive since the 60s, that long hair is the sure sign of immoral behavior. It never ceases to amaze me that people will eat up the same exact panic about youth subcultures over and over again without noticing that these panics amount to exactly nothing. But it&#8217;s different this time! It&#8217;s not just about having long hair anymore.</p>
<blockquote><p>To be emo is to be depressed, for sure. Or at least posing to be so. Kids who are emo, according to those who are and those who are watching closely, spend a lot of time talking about being depressed, they favor black zip-up hooded sweatshirts and girl pants (yes, boys pluck tight jeans from the girls department), wear bangs that are sometimes longer than the rest of their hair, pen their angst on their arms, legs, hands, even their faces, and experiment with cutting, the practice of injuring themselves with any sharp objects.</p>
<p>Oh, and they favor black-rimmed eyewear known as &#8220;emo glasses.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Black-rimmed eyeglasses? They must be serious. Boys wearing girl pants? That&#8217;s it, the end of sexual reproduction as we know it. You can kiss those hopes for grandchildren goodbye.***</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if 75% of our political problems in this country would dissipate if people grasped the basic concept that just because something is annoying doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s intolerable.</p>
<p>*I really hate the way the media pretends that only teenagers use MySpace. (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/amandamarcotte">*cough*</a>) Bloggers and musicians are also big fans of MySpace, though to be fair, that doesn&#8217;t do much to prove that MySpace is a hotbed of mature behavior. <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&#038;friendID=33648036&#038;blogID=123920910&#038;Mytoken=C5F50AF6-B638-4790-9AEA257CA96A9DF9329015937"> But this might help improve the site&#8217;s hapless image</a>.<br />
**Because I&#8217;d worry that this theoretical teenage kid of mine would irritate me so much I&#8217;d have to kill him and start over from scratch.</p>
<p>***Since of course, that&#8217;s exactly what happened when long hair on men resulted in nationwide emasculation in the 60s and Americans died off because we couldn&#8217;t sexually reproduce anymore.

<p><a href="http://alicublog.blogspot.com/2006_05_21_alicublog_archive.html#114839458812865650">From Roy Edroso</a>, it looks like the wingnuts are whining that Ramesh Ponnuru isn&#8217;t getting the reviews in magazines they&#8217;d like for his book titled <em>The Party of Death</em>, a title that does indeed tell you everything you need to know about his characterization of the view that women have reproductive rights. <a href="http://www.theamericanscene.com/2006/05/more-death-i-should-have-noted-in.php">Ross Douthat has an issue with Kevin Drum</a> saying the book isn&#8217;t worth reviewing and his post is a howler.</p>
<blockquote><p>He&#8217;s right: the question of whether life begins at conception takes up &#8220;a whole chapter&#8221; . . . in a book with roughly twenty chapters. In some of the chapters Drum didn&#8217;t find time to read in Barnes and Noble, there is actually a great deal of material about infanticide and euthanasia and slippery slope questions, and I would be very curious to know what Drum thinks about those issues and why he&#8217;s so sure they&#8217;re red herrings - but, ah yes, he didn&#8217;t read the book.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Ponnuru has found a way to magically turn the red herrings of the anti-choice movement into legitimate arguments, which Kevin would see if he just read it. That would make sense if there was any way for a red herring to be converted into the central belief, but if indeed the anti-choicers suddenly quit using &#8220;life&#8221; as a cover for anti-woman motivations and became deeply interested in the actual issue of saving human lives, they wouldn&#8217;t be conservative anymore due to their unfortunate new support of contraception, universal health care, and the end of war in Iraq, amongst other causes. The very existence of the book is a red herring so it&#8217;s safe to say the arguments to be found within are also red herrings.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d also be curious to get Drum&#8217;s take, or the take of any smart liberal, on many of the other issues Ramesh raises: the falsification of history involved in abortion jurisprudence (and the role of the historical profession in that falsification)</p></blockquote>
<p>The existence of conspiracy theories about how historians are in cahoots with the feminist cabal to conceal history isn&#8217;t really a selling point when trying to argue that this book should be legitimized by the also-fictional &#8220;liberal media&#8221;. Also, rewriting the &#8220;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&#8221; and trying to get it reviewed in the NY Times is going to be a fruitless pursuit.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m honestly flummoxed as to how it is that one can just know for a fact that historians are lying about the past just because you find the facts inconvenient. Actually, I do know where such knowledge comes from.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stoopidgerl/151702691/in/pool-religiouskitsch/">Picture from here</a>.)</p>
<p>The standards for what counts as a reasonable argument that deserves mainstream attention are already distressingly low because the conservative side keeps getting a fat handicap to keep things &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221;. The very fact that <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/05/dont_worry_skeptico.php">a non-theory like &#8220;intelligent design&#8221; </a>has wormed its way into the mainstream shows that we as a society are scrapping the bottom of the barrel in giving the dealers of religious horseshit a pass. I for one am glad to see Kevin Drum and others taking stands against playing along with Ponnuru&#8217;s attempt to lower the standards even more to give faith-based arguments secular credibility.</p>
<p>For further humor value, I recommend reading Ross whine that he&#8217;s so not a misogynist in the same damn post where he singles out <em>Roe vs. Wade</em> for criticism because of the health exception. Faith-based non-misogyny, in other words. In the real world, whining that women are getting away with being healthy far too often for your comfort is solid evidence that you may in fact have something against women. <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/2006/05/post_428.html">Matt, as usual, is good at seeing the forest for all the red herrings that anti-choicers put up</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>But Ross and Ponnuru both actually are serious Catholics who actually do subscribe to a whole set of conservative views about sex and gender beyond questions about the legal status of abortion. Now if you found a secular humanist who thinks premarital sex and gay marriage are great, and women who don&#8217;t work are traitors to the sisterhood but who also thought that criminalizing abortion was a good idea, that might be an interesting book.</p></blockquote>
<p>The anti-choicers who are otherwise perfectly comfortable with women&#8217;s equality and sexual freedom that I keep hearing about never seem to materialize. I know of exactly <a href="http://hugoboy.typepad.com/">one person </a>I&#8217;ve talked to in all this time I&#8217;ve been writing and debating these issues with people that I could say outright convinced me that he is serious about his feminism while being anti-choice, but even then the cognitive dissonance made him come around to leaning towards pro-choice (though still anti-abortion) since I first threatened to kick him if I ever meet him. (For which I apologized.)</p>
<p>For those who want to know, Discoballmousetarians do not weigh in on the &#8220;when life begins&#8221; question. There is no such thing as &#8220;life&#8221;, since all energy is an illusion caused by the light of the Disco Ball flashing in your eyes. Our view on traditional gender roles is that the Charleston ended the need for them.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hate to even bring this media-loving turd back from the gossip grave, but this is just over the top.</p>
<p>Since OJ is <a target="_blank" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2442584">joking around with this low-life behavior</a>, it  must mean that he&#8217;s completed his mission to <u>find the real killer</u>, right?</p>
<blockquote><p>In a scene from his new candid-camera program &#8220;Juiced,&#8221; O.J. Simpson pulls a prank involving the infamous white Bronco, drawing criticism from the family of a man he was accused of killing.</p>
<p>As part of the pay-per-view show, Simpson pretends to sell the Bronco at a used car lot and boasts to a prospective buyer that he made the vehicle famous, according to a segment aired Thursday on &#8220;Inside Edition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>It was good for me &#8212; it helped me get away</strong>,&#8221; Simpson said, referring to the slow-speed, televised police chase that preceded his 1994 arrest on charges of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.</p>
<p>Goldman&#8217;s father, Fred, told &#8220;Inside Edition&#8221; he found Simpson&#8217;s comment &#8220;morally reprehensible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This sh*t is so sick I really don&#8217;t know what to say.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And <a target="_blank" href="http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2006/05/oy-my-ass-hurts-oh-and-i-met-senator.html">Shakes Sis</a> was there &#8212; go girl.</p>
<p>And if you want to see yet another example of Dem queasiness on the position the party&#8217;s staked out on marriage amendments (&#8221;leave it to the states&#8221;), and the bind it puts them in, read on &#8212; you can feel Bayh squirming when confronted with the possibility of his own state passing one. He has nothing to stand on, which is precisely the point when we take the party to task on this punt &#8212; the Dems cannot stand for equality if the party is willing to endorse the position that states can simply vote discrimination into their constitutions.</p>
<p>Remember, Bayh is likely to jump into the 2008 race and this is the best he can do on this issue. This is f*cking weak. My emphasis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Then it was time for the Senator to arrive. He came in and introduced himself to everyone individually, then was seated one chair away from me. He didn’t give a prepared statement; just opened it up for questions. Bil [Browning of <a href="http://www.bilerico.com/">Bilerico</a>] got things off to a roaring start by questioning the Senator about the Federal Marriage Amendment. Bayh said he had voted against it before, and would vote against it again. <strong>Then Bil followed up by asking about the amendment on Indiana’s state ballot, which is up for a vote next year. On this, the Senator struggled.</strong> It’s dangerous to punt with a statement like, “It’s a state issue” when your home state’s currently considering an anti-gay marriage measure and there are people from that state sitting in front of you asking you questions. I desperately hoped he’d plainly state his objections to a discriminatory amendment, but alas, he did not. <strong>He said he hadn’t read it and didn’t really have an answer</strong>. Not good.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the problem. The Dem position leaves candidates completely vulnerable &#8212; are you for or against discrimination. It&#8217;s that simple. You have to be able to explain why it&#8217;s OK for states to make its gay and lesbian tax payers second-class citizens, instead of diving behind your &#8220;no&#8221; vote on a federal amendment. States are deciding by popular vote to discriminate. How is this fine with a Democratic party that allegedly believes in civil equality? And don&#8217;t worry, the Rethugs will corner you and kill you on this one. It&#8217;s a stupid fallback position that&#8217;s no longer working as the state amendments pass.</p>
<p>At least with the anti-gay elected bigots, you don&#8217;t have any question where they stand on the issue.</p>
<p>And my bloggrrrrl brought her laser-beam humor to the event and zinged Bayh on impeachment.</p>
<blockquote><p>As for me, I tried to think of a question that the Shakers would like to see answered, and what I came up with was asking the Senator whether he supported Nancy Pelosi’s decision to <a target="_blank" href="http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2006/05/interesting.html">take impeachment off the table</a> in the House, even though thorough investigations of the administration haven’t been done and polls show that Americans increasingly support impeachment. Bayh said (paraphrasing), “Remember when the Republicans were going nuts in pursuit on Clinton…?” And because<strong> I apparently cannot control my smart-assitude even when sitting two feet away from a Senator, I said, “No, I don’t remember that at all. When was that?” Okay, the other bloggers laughed, but Bayh didn’t seem to find it all that funny.</strong> Sorry, Senator. He went on to say that the American people didn’t like it when the Republican Congress went after Clinton when they should have been paying attention to jobs and the economy and shit, and there was a backlash, and the Dems won seats during midterms—and if the Dems tried to impeach Bush, the same thing would happen, because it would be viewed as motivated by a vendetta.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sis points out, rightfully so, that the Dems have no brain or a spine, because there was no backlash against the Rethugs &#8212; here we are in the nightmare term 2 of this administration (and the only reason the Rethugs are in trouble is because of their own corruption and malfeasance).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s ridiculous is that this position presumes that there is some equivalence between a lying about a BJ and Dear Leader&#8217;s torching of the Constitution to suit his needs. What on earth what would qualify in Dem minds as grounds for impeachment when all they are worried about is imaginary political &#8220;backlash?&#8221; How about considering what might be the best thing to do for the country when the executive branch is power-mad and out of control? Taking it off the table as a strategy is a worthy question for these Dems to answer fully, given there so much up in the air that could come crashing down on the Bushies.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/20/nyregion/20mccain.html?ex=1305777600&#038;en=ad1f0f07982ece56&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">Jean Rohe&#8217;s speech at the New School&#8217;s convocation</a> where she attacked Senator John McCain for his support of failed Bush administration policies is already getting the <a href="http://lawandpolitics.blogspot.com/2006_05_01_lawandpolitics_archive.html#114827142349328858">over-wrung hands on the left wrung even tighter </a>at the thought of running off the supposedly skittish moderate middle. Visions of spoiled middle class college kids who are fond of chanting slogans, avoiding showers and pissing off their elders dance through the heads of the hand-wringers, <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2006/05/rohes_dissent.html">but thankfully Ezra Klein is here to breathe some commons sense into the discussion</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rohe won&#8217;t have the same impact. But her speech was useful just the same. Protests are useful for shattering consensus, but student marchers are ignored because protesting appears to be their consensus. Rohe quietly slipped out of the second box, and comfortably returned to the form&#8217;s roots. So far as the media is concerned, McCain is universally beloved, a hero to one and all. Central to this narrative is his ability to seamlessly transition from a speech at Falwell&#8217;s Liberty College to an address at Kerrey&#8217;s New School. Indeed, central to this narrative is his ability to give the same speech at both. Had the event been unremarkable, had it passed without polite applause, without punishment for his appearance at Liberty, the storyline would have been affirmed. Rohe intercepted it, effectively locking his door to the left. He may be welcome at Liberty, but he was not welcome at New School. Speaking for the left, or at least the school McCain was using to represent the left, she put the lie to his tale. In doing, she shattered the consensus, and so mounted that rarest of all acts: an effective protest.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m skeptical of the fear of having college kids representing the opposition to the war and the Republican hegemony for a different reason. I&#8217;m not impressed with the idea that there&#8217;s widespread opposition to the existence of college kids or even opinionated college kids. The ubiquitious conservative propaganda slurring college professors, politically engaged college students and the university culture gives people the impression that there&#8217;s a groundswell of anti-college feeling in the general public, and there&#8217;s no doubt that you can get some knee-jerk antagonism from people by invoking lazy, spoiled college kids who go to protests to get laid.</p>
<p>But Jean Rohe is a different creature altogether. A honored student and talented jazz singer <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jean-rohe/why-i-spoke-up_b_21358.html">who works with preschoolers i</a>s most people&#8217;s idea of a dream daughter. That Rohe called McCain out before he even made his speech for his prescripted remarks that amounted to &#8220;kids these days ain&#8217;t good for nothing&#8221; and proved him wrong simply by being said dream daughter works well as a symbol for what&#8217;s really going on in this country with regards to the status of a college education. I think most people in this country still have a lot of respect for higher education and would like a degree for themselves or their kids. McCain wasn&#8217;t tapping anti-college kid sentiment so much as he was furthering the Republican agenda of creating such sentiment where it didn&#8217;t exist before. As commenters at Ezra&#8217;s noted, you can tell that Rohe&#8217;s strategy worked well because McCain&#8217;s supporters have been reduced to invoking his stint as a POW in defense, as if it matters in this particular situation.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because I like to torture myself, I popped on over to the Dawn Patrol to see what we perverts are supposedly doing this week to destroy Western civilization. <a href="http://www.dawneden.com/2006/05/sex-and-bitty.html">This week demystifying sex is our great sin</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The real sin here is the what I believe is the great sin of the sexual revolution: the idea that sex needs to be &#8220;demystified.&#8221; That&#8217;s the line of thinking that makes perverts prey upon young girls. It also makes parents let their children watch obscene films or read porn magazines — as I saw a father do with his 10-year-old son on the train last week — because &#8220;the kids&#8217;ll just see them anyway, so it&#8217;s better that we know about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>To deprive sex of its spiritual component — which is what the hippies did, and the beatniks before them, and the Theosophists and Sangerites before them — is to reduce human beings to disposable commodities.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Sangerites&#8221; may sound like a religious order but I suspect she means &#8220;people who use birth control&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;m having trouble believing the childbirth, a situation that calls for a larger number of people than most are really comfortable with taking a gander at your genitals is the best method of keeping a veil of mystery around sex.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that sexual revolutionaries support demystifying sex, but that&#8217;s not because we&#8217;re anti-romance. In fact, I for one am pro-romance and would like to avoid having a romantic moment punctured by someone whispering huskily in my ear, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry but I&#8217;m not quite sure where to put this.&#8221; Beatniks are romantic like that.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s not true is that demystifying sex through filmed portrayals of it is the cause of pedophilia. I&#8217;m not sure what the cause of pedophilia is, but ever since I wrote that post mocking John Derbyshire, I&#8217;ve had the great opportunity of deleting comments in my moderation queue from pedophiles that would like to explain to me in crude and insulting language that I&#8217;m just jealous of little girls because I&#8217;ve got the great misfortune of menstruating and having disgusting, fleshy parts most people like to call &#8220;curves&#8221;. After boiling my computer, I can safely say that pedophiles agree with Dawn that graphic nudity, at least the kind that involves naked, grown women, should never see the light of day. Or so they say.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://punkassblog.com/2006/05/22/red-bull-for-the-ladies-2/">Punkass Marc has a post on this bizarre marketing campaign for Tab Energy</a> which is targeted towards very dumb, shallow women. So dumb and shallow I suspect they don&#8217;t exist. He describes all the various odd claims from the site, but my favorite part is they have interactive &#8220;business&#8221; cards for women to give out on social occasions. You can customize your cards on the site. I did my own.</p>
