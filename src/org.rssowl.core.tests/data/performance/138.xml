    <description>&lt;p&gt;While it might be all to easy to criticise, moan and bitch about the vagaries of &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"&gt;WCAG 2.0&lt;/a&gt; (and even easier to do that rather than contributing - remember, folks, &lt;a href="http://accessify.com/2006/04/last-call-working-draft-of-web-content.php"&gt;last call on WCAG 2.0&lt;/a&gt;!) , the fact is that there has been an awful lot of work put in by a lot of very hard-working people. One such person is &lt;a href="http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/%7Eslatin/"&gt;Dr John Slatin&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Texas, a blind accessibility expert whom many of the readers of this site either know of or have met personally (&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jflint/6460657/"&gt;possibly at SXSW&lt;/a&gt;). It was with great sadness, therefore, that I &lt;a href="http://www.glendathegood.com/blog"&gt;learned today&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="http://leukemialetters.blogspot.com/2006/05/bad-news-leukemia-is-back.html"&gt;John is very ill with leukemia&lt;/a&gt;, an illness that he believed he had &lt;a href="http://leukemialetters.blogspot.com/2005/12/biopsy-results-no-leukemia.html"&gt;beaten back in December last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote cite="http://leukemialetters.blogspot.com/2006/05/bad-news-leukemia-is-back.html"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The reason I had the brain scan is that I noticed what seemed like a significant increase in the number and type of errors I made while typing; it just seemed that signals were getting crissed somehow between the words that formed in my mind and the words that came out through my figers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the typo in that last sentence was Johns' and he's decided to leave them in on the basis that there may be something that could later be gleaned from any patterns in his errors (which makes it all the more difficult to read - not from a technical point of view, rather an emotional one - when it appears that the typos appear to be getting worse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/LeukemiaDiaries/"&gt;support group on Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; that Gordon Montgomery has set up for John and Anna, including this &lt;a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/LeukemiaDiaries/message/1"&gt;very touching note from John&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="http://leukemialetters.blogspot.com/"&gt;John continues to blog about his experiences here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

The buzz for 2006 is &lt;acronym title="Web Accessibility Initiative"&gt;WAI&lt;/acronym&gt;'s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0; and in the UK, also &lt;a href="http://www.bsi-global.com/ICT/PAS78/index.xalter"&gt;&lt;acronym title="Publicly Available Specification"&gt;PAS&lt;/acronym&gt; 78&lt;/a&gt;. You'll learn how &lt;abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"&gt;WCAG&lt;/abbr&gt; 2.0 fits in the big picture, and get a jump start on using &lt;abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"&gt;WCAG&lt;/abbr&gt; 2.0 effectively. They'll also talk about including people with disabilities throughout a human- or user-centered design process (UCD). Julie Howell from the &lt;a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/"&gt;Royal National Institute for the Blind&lt;/a&gt; (RNIB) will overview &lt;acronym title="Publicly Available Specification"&gt;PAS&lt;/acronym&gt; 78, including the role of guidelines and users.

    <title>All aboard the PAS 78 gravy train</title>
    <link>http://accessify.com/2006/05/all-aboard-pas-78-gravy-train.php</link>

The &lt;acronym title="Publicly Available Specification"&gt;PAS&lt;/acronym&gt; is not a new set of accessibility guidelines. It's a document aimed at people who &lt;strong&gt;commission websites&lt;/strong&gt;. It's completely nonsensical for a company that &lt;strong&gt;develops websites&lt;/strong&gt; to claim that their products and services comply with the &lt;acronym title="Publicly Available Specification"&gt;PAS&lt;/acronym&gt;. At a pinch, you could say that your development processes are in line with some of the recommendations of the &lt;acronym title="Publicly Available Specification"&gt;PAS&lt;/acronym&gt;, particularly the user testing aspects. But even that is really stretching it, in my not so humble opinion. Stick with claiming &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"&gt;WCAG&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compliance. Heck, the &lt;acronym title="Publicly Available Specification"&gt;PAS&lt;/acronym&gt; itself has the following to say about companies claiming to create sites that are "&lt;abbr title="Disability Discrimination Act"&gt;DDA&lt;/abbr&gt;-compliant":&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.1.1 It is not possible to provide a definitive specification for a fully accessible website which will satisfy the requirements of the &lt;abbr title="Disability Discrimination Act"&gt;DDA&lt;/abbr&gt;. Website commissioners should therefore be sceptical if contracting companies declare that they will create websites that are "&lt;abbr title="Disability Discrimination Act"&gt;DDA&lt;/abbr&gt;-compliant" or "compliant with the law". Conversely, website commissioners should not require a web designer to design a website that is "&lt;abbr title="Disability Discrimination Act"&gt;DDA&lt;/abbr&gt;-compliant" or "compliant with the law". Until case law has been established such claims cannot be made or honoured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that is the general advice given with regards to companies claiming "&lt;abbr title="Disability Discrimination Act"&gt;DDA&lt;/abbr&gt;-compliance", I'd imagine that site commissioners should be even more skeptical of companies claiming "&lt;acronym title="Publicly Available Specification"&gt;PAS&lt;/acronym&gt; 78 compliance".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.webstandards.org/2006/05/11/all-aboard-the-pas-78-gravy-train/" title="Web Standards Project post: All aboard the PAS 78 gravy train"&gt;Cross-posted over on the &lt;acronym title="Web Standards Project"&gt;WaSP&lt;/acronym&gt;.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick heads-up - as readers of this site may be (or, more hopefully, &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;) aware, Patrick, myself, Gez Lemon and Andy Clarke are hosting a &lt;a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/sessions/#new"&gt;panel on &lt;abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"&gt;WCAG&lt;/abbr&gt; 2.0&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote cite="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/sessions/#new"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In this panel, we'll try and get to grips with the philosophy, the content, the good, the bad, and the controversies of the second edition of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and look at how they impact on areas such as design, or the use of widgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's what the blurb says, and we've certainly got our ideas about what to cover but we're interested to get some feedback in advance - or rather some questions in advance - that you might like to hear us cover on the day itself. If you have a comment, be that a simple question, something that you'd like clarifying or a rant about your personal pet hate with WCAG 2.0, please add it here and we'll do our best to incorporate it on the day. Over to you ... &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Scared of the Dark?</title>
    <link>http://accessify.com/2006/05/scared-of-dark.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a 'micro-posting' from me on the topic of &lt;a href="http://www.webstandards.org/2006/05/04/ajax-accessibility-and-screenreaders/"&gt;Ajax and Accessibility&lt;/a&gt;. With the recent research presented by fully-sighted gurus &lt;a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/ajax-screenreaders-work"&gt;James Edwards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://joeclark.org/ice/"&gt;Joe Clark&lt;/a&gt;, many of us have been enlightened once more to the need for creating accessible web applications in the face of new techniques that update page content without a page refresh. This quote, from an &lt;a href="http://computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;amp;articleId=111219"&gt;article in Computerworld&lt;/a&gt;, really brought home the impact of not paying heed to to this and just how confusing some of the new web applications can be for blind users. Note that the person quoted is blind and emphasis added is mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote cite="http://computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;amp;articleId=111219"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; "It's &lt;strong&gt;very, very, very&lt;/strong&gt; scary," said Jeff Bishop, an application systems analyst at the University of Arizona in Tucson. "Before, so what? You had a missing [alternative-text] tag, but at least you knew there was an image. You could click on it, and maybe you could figure out what it was. Now, &lt;strong&gt;you don't even know where to click&lt;/strong&gt;. You &lt;strong&gt;don't know how to interact&lt;/strong&gt;." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a pretty strong statement, but you cannot argue with it really - this is a blind user saying what he thnks of the whole web 2.0/ajax implication for him as a user. A strong case, surely, for the assistive technology vendors to start seriously addressing this issue, no?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AJAX, Accessibility &amp;amp; Screen Readers</title>
    <link>http://accessify.com/2006/05/ajax-accessibility-screen-readers.php</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;There's something of an &lt;a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=oxymoron"&gt;oxymoron&lt;/a&gt; going on there in the heading. Can you spot it? The words 'accessibility' and 'AJAX'. They really are not the best of bed fellows, as many people have discovered. However, although many of us web professionals just 'kinda know' that AJAX is bad for web accessibility, when pushed many would not be able to say exactly why or how certain screen readers cope with content that's been changed using AJAX (or using DOM Scripting methods that don't make use of AJAX at all). One man who can claim to know a bit about it is James Edwards (aka &lt;a href="http://www.brothercake.com/"&gt;Brothercake&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote cite="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/ajax-screenreaders-work"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Over the last few months (and earlier) I've been involved in researching how the leading screen readers and other assistive devices respond to JavaScript: what kinds of events they generate or respond to, and under what circumstances. The research is based at &lt;a href="http://www.access-matters.com/index/index-of-javascript-tests/"&gt;Access Matters &lt;/a&gt;, and coordinated by Bob Easton, Derek Featherstone, Mike Stenhouse and myself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In addition to that, I did a great deal of primary research for my recently published book, &lt;a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/jsant1/"&gt;The JavaScript Anthology &lt;/a&gt;. The research was designed to find out how assistive devices respond to scripts that update the &lt;a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/glossary.php?q=D#term_39"&gt;DOM &lt;/a&gt; periodically or asynchronously, such as the items in a scrolling news-ticker, or responses to an XMLHttpRequest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is an excerpt from an article that James has published on Sitepoint entitled &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/ajax-screenreaders-work"&gt;AJAX and Screenreaders: When Can it Work?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; which I strongly advise all web professionals to read and absorb. Even if you're not currently doing 'cool' things with AJAX, you should read it so that you are aware of the impact of any future development work, should you choose to go down that road.
