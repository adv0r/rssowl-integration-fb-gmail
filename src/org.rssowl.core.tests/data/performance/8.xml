 <title>Localizing the Broadband Battle</title>
 <link>http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000043</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If &amp;quot;all politics is local&amp;quot;, as Tip O&#039;Niell famously said, can&#039;t we say the same about all business? If so, maybe we should start walking our Net Neutrality talk on our own main streets.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Welcome to my blog</title>
 <link>http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000042</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of things to say in this new blog, but I am currently neck deep in finishing up my work on the Ultimate Linux Box issue.  I hope to get back here later today to post something on the AM2, since the embargo on the NDA (non-disclosure agreement) has expired today.  You&#039;ll have to wait for the details, but let me summarize my take on the AM2 in these words:  Drink lots of liquids before you attempt to read my writeup, because you&#039;re going to lose a lot of drool.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Linux System Administration in the New ERA</title>
 <link>http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000041</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The success of Mozilla&#039;s Firefox and Openoffice.org&#039;s productivity suite has breathed life into people&#039;s aspirations about Desktop Linux. As a result, the vast majority of articles published today focus there and ignore the strides made on the Linux server. Unlike the Linux server of the past, today&#039;s version supports rocket science and its gains far exceed those of the Desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Linux System Administration: Growth in the Enterprise</title>
 <link>http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000040</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Trout Creek, Montana hardly seems like a place one would expect to find a center of Linux learning. Please do not tell Mike Weber of  SpiderTools that. He spent the last six years developing one of the more robust training facilities in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Rise of Independent Media</title>
 <link>http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000039</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What would happen if anybody could produce radio or TV programming as easily as they consume it?&lt;br&gt;What would happen if the natural limits to broadcasting went away?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those questions only had sci-fi answers when I was a kid growing up in New Jersey, not far from the swamps later re-labeled &amp;quot;meadowlands&amp;quot;, after a sports complex by that name appeared alongside Paterson Plank Road. In those days, back in the &#039;50s and early &#039;60s, I was like any other geeky kid who had better luck with science than with girls: I sublimated unrequited desire for the latter into preoccupation with the former. Since computers were still captive to big business, big defense and big science, I focused my science obsessions on big radio.&lt;/p&gt;
