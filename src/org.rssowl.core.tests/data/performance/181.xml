This is obviously a first novel, but that doesn't dim the fact that I find the main character fascinating. I am troubled by the choppy narrative, because I often had to go back and remind myself who was who. I did like the difficult relationship that develops between Elzith and Redtanner and wanted more of that and less of the petty intriguing of the Justices. I'm not</summary>

I have to admit I was delighted when I learned that this author was Canadian. It doesn't seem often that I come across a Canadian author who write fantasy fiction. I first read Bitten a couple of years ago and loved it. I loved it so much I read it twice before I let it go back to the library! So when I came across this novel I snapped it up without a thought, and I</summary>

I became hooked on Emiliana when a friend recommended her to me and I hunted around for some samples. I like this album because it reminds me at times of the melancholy of Portishead and the desire inherent in Goldfrapp. I'm still thoroughly enjoying this album - much to the SO's annoyance since I've listened to it six times in a row today. :)</summary>

I thought this was a good first novel. Not only was this author brave enough to attempt it in the first person, but she managed to do so while keeping the story going throughout, which I admit is one of my weaknesses. Rabbit is definately an interesting character, but I would have liked to explore him a little more. There were, however, a few too many characters for</summary>

I picked this album up after hearing and falling in love with the track "Train" when it was played on the local radio station. It's remeniscent of Portishead, (which is one of my all time favourites) and occasionally of Massive Attack. Allison Godlfrapp's voice is capable of being haunting and provocative at the same time. The songs go from trippy sound collage to</summary>

What drew me first to this series (both the manga and the OVA) was the artwork. I stumbled across an image of Alexiel, which I used for my desktop for a few months before I found out who it was. The idea behind the story is fabulously twisted and even though I have yet to see the last episodes, or read the last mangas I'm hooked.
