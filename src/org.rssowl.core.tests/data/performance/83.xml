<![CDATA[<p>"Are you going to destroy Sharon and Helo's relationship or give it a stronger foundation? From my POV, Sharon's reactions and actions are consistent with the Sharon we met on Caprica. I'm not particularly mushy, but this very human story is one of the primary reasons I watch the show. That this Sharon might have PPD and PTSS is reasonable and I hope that when we see her in the Season three she will be healed and moving foward with her life outside the cage. This fan doesn't care how she gets out of the cage as long as she does. "</p>

<p>Their relationship will continue to grow and evolve.  That's not to say it won't have the ups and downs of any relationship, but we're not looking to destroy it.  The issue of the cage, what she's been doing in it, and what her future is will be dealt with in the first couple of episodes.</p>

<p><br />
"Are you planning a Sharon swap? Will you swap AdorablyCylonCagedSharon with DownloadedMosesBoomer in terms of which Sharon will be onboard Galactica for the duration of the series? I pray you don't sacrifice one Sharon for another. I've never confused the two versions of Sharon and I believe you and your writing staff can make room for them both of them. "</p>

<p>I'm happy with the fact that we crossed each Sharon over into the other world and I'm not planning to reswap them again.  There's also no plan at the moment to destory either one.</p>

<p><br />
"In the season two finale, before it was revealed that Sharon didn't fess up about Cavel, was Brother Cavel going to reveal himself as a Cylon? I ask because he said something akin to the Cylons seeking greener pastures. It's unlikely he'd say he was a Cylon in the hanger bay, but I wonder if he was going to fess up in private. Was he truly there to deliver the message?"</p>

<p>He was planning to reveal himself and deliver a message.  Whether there was more to his plan than that is speculative at this point, and anything's possible, but our feeling is that was his primary function.</p>

<p><br />
"Are there no animals seen on the show on purpose? (I'm guessing its to avoid weird "alien" cats with three eyes like on Trek episodes.) So far I've only seen rats (Helo with Sharon) and snakes (in a Roslin hallucination)."</p>

<p>We hadn't gotten around to showing them in prior episodes, but we have talked about dogs, cats, and chickens on the show and one would imagine that they'd be very familiar looking without additional goofy prosthetics.  In the first couple eps of season three, there will be at least one animal featured in a subplot.</p>

<p><br />
"Why are the home worlds other than Caprica not really mentioned? Was there one planet per tribe?"</p>

<p>It's just a factor of Caprica having had the capital city of the Twelve Colonies.  That put Laura there in the miniseries and it was natural to have Baltar there as well so as to keep the confusion factor to a minimum for the audience rather than trying to establish and identify more than one planet.  Same goes for the reason Helo & Sharon put down there in the mini.  So from that point forward, Caprica sort of becomes the default planet to reference and deal with.  We have talked about Saggitaron and Gemenon and sketched out the particulars of their cultures, but we just haven't done a lot more with the rest of them, which is unfortunate.</p>

<p><br />
"Why don't Cylon raiders fire conventional missiles anymore?"</p>

<p>That's a good question and Gary Hutzel brought this up himself.  I think it's something we just kinda stopped thinking about as we were working on the dogfight seqeunces, because they were already so complex that adding yet another layer on top seemed overwhelming.  However, I agree that it's something we've established and should try to reintegrate into the show again.</p>

<p><br />
"Ron, in Starship Troopers (the book, not the movie) it says:<br />
Quote:<br />
"The last thing a trooper hears before a drop (maybe the last word he ever hears) is a woman's voice, wishing him luck. If you don't think this is important, you've probably resigned from the human race." --Starship Troopers, p. 161<br />
Alot of scifi works follow this convention (Aliens, Halo, etc.) I've realized that both of the Raptor transport pilots on the show, first Boomer and later Racetrack, are female. Was this a conscious choice, to follow the ST quote? Do you agree with it? </p>

<p><br />
I don't recall that quote -- although I read "Starship Troopers" a long time ago.  It's coincidental that Racetrack & Boomer were women, and I never really thought of the Raptor as a transport, I usually thought of it as analogous to the Navy's EA-6 Prowler (a variant of the A-6 Intruder popularized in "Flight of the Intruder").  Dualla, however is the one who communicates most often with the pilots and I actually made her a woman because she was filling the role of another woman in the original BSG series who used to man the communication system on their bridge.  That character was called "Rigel" but I didn't think that name worked in the remake, so I gave her the name of Dualla.</p>

<p>(As a side note, Roddenberry made a similar decision on the original "Star Trek" series when he made the computer voice a woman -- I think there's an anecdote in Stephen Whitfield's "The Making of Star Trek" where they did some research about the US Air Force deciding that pilots listened to or responded better to a female voice.)</p>

<p><br />
"What annoyed me a little last season was the civilian population complaining about this and that, pressuring the government to take certain actions. You would think that in such desperate times of war, when the entire human race (or at least what's known of it) has been reduced to a mere few thousand people, that the military would basically ignore the 'will of the people' and do things their way. </p>

<p>"I mean the civilians have Galactica to thank for their lives. They know they are screwed if Galactica leaves them. So why do they sometimes behave like whiney babies? You would think they would be willing to do just about anything other than jump out an airlock for the military. </p>

<p>"I hope next season Adama will have learned his lesson: the average person is stupid. Democracy gets people like George W. Bush elected. It is not a perfect system. In such desperate times, you really can't risk the people electing the wrong person for the job, the military should take absolute power (yet allow the people to govern their daily affairs, just as long as it doesn't conflict with military interests)."</p>

<p>I've talked about this before, but it's worth reiterating.  Adama's deference to the democratic system is a fundamental idea in the series.  These people have to make adult decisions for themselves and decide what kind of life they will have or not have as the case may be.  Yes, they can be selfish and petty and make bad choices, but at least they will have done them through the democratic process and have no one to blame for their choices but themselves.  </p>

<p>Who is Adama to take god-like control of the human race?  Who appointed him to that position?  And what makes him qualified to make those decisions?  Consider the example of Admiral Cain -- she arrogated those kind of powers to herself and look at what happened.  If they put themselves in the hands of the military and live under martial law, there's no check or balance in that system, no mechanism to rein in the officer who decides to go off the reservation and consider themselves above the law (at least in the Galactica scenario).</p>

<p>Laura Roslin is the legal president.  Adama recognizes that as part of the covenant the professional military has always had with Colonial society:  that they are the servants and protectors of the people, not their masters.   </p>

<p><br />
"First, a BZ: Speaking as a (so far) 15-year Navy veteran with two Air Wing/Carrier tours under my belt, your show is the most faithful and compelling depiction of life on an aircraft carrier that I have ever seen on television (and in most movies). Obviously the trappings are very different, but the characters, the things they do, and their motivations for doing those things ring true to my ears. (And one small thing I loved in the pilot: the 1MC announcements about personnel working EVA.) And this is totally separate from the fact that BSG is also one of the best dramas on television in recent memory. Bravo, sir!</p>

<p>"Question 1: I've read in online bios that a knee injury prevented you from entering the service on your NROTC scholarship. If this hadn't happened, what community would you have wanted to join? In other words, did you want to be a SWO-dog, an Airedale, or a Bubble-head? Or something else?"</p>

<p>First, thanks for the praise -- it's exceptionally meaningful coming from a member of the armed forces and I really appreciate it. </p>

<p>As to your question, my being dropped from NROTC was a combination of things -- first and foremost my college grades, which were to say the least, abysmal in my senior year at Cornell.  I essentially imploded my senior year and flunked out with only a semester to go before graduation.  Oddly enough, I passed all my Naval Science courses, but basically slept and partied and slept some more through that last semester.  I also failed a physical around the same time because of my knee (which I'd injured playing football).</p>

<p>Technically speaking, I was a Marine Option Midshipman and heading for the Marine Corps.  My father was a Marine and that was a big part of the reason I went that route, but in truth, I longed to be a naval officer.  I kept thinking about switching options, but there were various obstacles to doing so, not the least of which were the daunting (to me) math requirements that the Navy program required and the Marine program did not.  There were also bureaucratic obstacles in the way, but the bottom line was, I was in a delay & denial mode for a lot of my college days regarding my future and I never really acted on the desire to switch.</p>

<p>My first preference in either world would've been to fly, but my vision wasn't 20/20 at the time and I didn't qualify for pilot training.  I thought about the Naval Flight Officer program, but the Marines seemed to be limiting those billets at the time (mid-80's) and there was way too much math involved for not getting to actually fly the plane.  Intelligence Officer had definite appeal, but I remember them saying that specialty was off-limits for NROTC graduates for some reason.  If I had actually made the switch to the Navy, I would've opted for Surface Warfare; there was something about serving on a warship at sea that appealed to me in a fundamental (if admittedly romantic) way.  Assuming I'd continued into the Marines, I would've asked for infantry officer, like my father.  There was something basic, something almost primal, about commanding a rifle platoon that felt like a good way to test myself and see what I was made of.</p>

<p>It's interesting that I've almost never mentioned the fact that I was a Marine Midshipman -- I almost invariably talk about being on track to join the Navy.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe it's a bit of wishing my way onto the path I thought I would've been happier on, or maybe it has to do with lingering embarassment over my washing out of the whole program, or who knows what.  </p>

<p>The closest I've come to making peace with this part of my past came about three years after I'd washed out.  I went back to Cornell to see friends at my fraternity (K.A.) and hang out a bit, and I found a old box with some of my junk still in it.  Most of it was literally trash, but when I found my old shoulder boards, I felt like I'd done something wrong by leaving them there to tarnish in a box.  Men had fought and died with that Eagle, Globe, and Anchor on their collars and it bothered me that I'd tossed mine aside so cavalierly.  So I put them in an envelope with a note and left them at the door to the NROTC unit up at Barton Hall.  I remember I wrote something like, these meant something to me once, and please return them to the unit and hope they find their way onto the shoulders of someone who deserved them instead of lying in a box of trash.  I felt better somehow after doing it, felt like I'd maybe shut the door on that chapter of my life, but in truth, I don't think I've ever really made peace with the experience and I probably never will.  There will always be a sense of something left undone, something incomplete, and certain questions about myself left unanswered.</p>

<p><br />
"Question 2: In the podcast for "Captain's Hand," you mention that the Pegasus engineer was not used to leading outside of the engineering spaces and, well, it showed. But it seemed to me that he also exhibited some of the ship's company vs. Air Wing mentality that so plagues so many carriers, particularly in how he dealt with Starbuck. Were you are aware of that black shoe vs. brown shoe dynamic on a carrier, and if so did it influence the behaviors of this character?"</p>

<p>I was aware of the blackshoe vs. brownshoe dynamics both on carriers and in the wider communities, so I definitely carried that over into "Captain's Hand."  Even in my limited personal experience, I could see the (mostly healthy) rivalries among the different specialties, espcially during my summer cruise aboard the USS W.S. Sims FF-1059.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Wanted to let you know that there's now enhanced material available on the podcasts, courtesy of SciFi.com, which consists of artwork and other images now associated with the last few podcasts.</p>

<p>Also, there's a new podcast available which was originally recorded last summer in the writers' room, featuring discussion of a few of the episodes from the second half of the season, including "Scar" and "Sacrifice."  There are a couple more podcasts in this vein I recorded as well last season which with probably get posted at some point, so keep checking the downloads page.  I'm also going to try to do some podcasts between now and the Season Three premiere, possibly with Mrs.Ron and other guests in attendance.</p>

<p>Okay, that's three blogs in one day.  You can't say I'm not trying.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>"The plot twist [of the finale] seems to share allot in common with the DeSanto Galactica continuation story, where the humans think they are safe from the cylons and revolt against the military by deciding to give up on Earth and to colonize another place called New Caprica. Were you at least partially inspired by this earlier concept? "</p>

<p>No.  I can honestly say that the idea for our finale was entirely home-grown.  I had lunch with Tom DeSanto a few weeks back and we talked about the struggles we both went through trying to get our respective versions of the show off the ground.   As he talked about his pilot concept, I shared many of the plot details from our finale and we both remarked on how some notions and ideas are simply either "in the ether" or have a certain inevitability to them.  It's reminiscent of the "Babylon 5" vs. "Deep Space 9" questions I used to get.  I was there when DS9 was being created and I knew for a fact that neither Michael Piller nor Rick Berman had any knowledge of the B-5 material, but when you're doing a series set on a space station, there were bound to be certain paths that writers found attractive (like having a female second officer, for instance).  In terms of Galactica, the idea that the people of the rag-tag fleet might one day come across a planet and decide to settle down permanently, is an idea that would probably occur to anyone approaching the material, and it's really a question of how you execute that idea which is key.</p>

<p><br />
"What happened to Adama in the season finale to change him so much? Why would a man who spent decades of his adult life standing watch for the Cylon return suddenly give in and allow the military to stand down? How could he convince himself that the Cylons weren't coming back after 1 year when the last time they waited 40 years? He knew settlement was wrong so why didn't he offer any resistance? "</p>

<p>I think people have a remarkable ability to convince themselves of just about anything.  Adama, like everyone else in the fleet, had been constantly on the run, constantly under stress, and constantly in danger of losing his life for months on end, with virtually no break from the metal walls surrounding him day in and day out.  When, finally, the people decided to end the long sojourn and settle on New Caprica, he had little choice but to comply with the results of a democratic election which hinged on that very question.  And as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, people began to relax, to believe that maybe they had really turned a corner, had really found a place to lay down their burdens and start a new life.  Adama was just as vulnerable to that attractive idea as anyone else, and as the men and women under him began to clamor for a new life, as the political leadership of New Caprica began to demand more and more military resources to support the civilian population, there came the point where Adama began to believe in the mirage too.  He's not perfect.  He never was.  He couldn't bring himself to leave his ship, but as age and fatigue began to set in, he started to let down his guard just a little -- not all at once and never completely, but just enough.</p>

<p>There were also practical considerations.  He was entirely alone out here.  No Admiralty to call for reinforcements or intelligence, no Justice Ministry to prosecute soldiers who simply never came back from the surface of New Caprica, and no friendly ear in the office of the president to get needed resources for the military ships maintaining their lonely vigil up in orbit.  He was alone and he was tired.  It's almost as simple as that.</p>

<p>I remember one of my most vivid memories from the immediate post 9/11 period was opening up the newspaper and reading about a physical confrontation in the streets between members of the New York police department and the New York fire department.  It was heartbreaking, it was infuriating and it was illuminating.  People are people.  Enormous events happen, history pivots around us and we tell ourselves that everything has changed, that we're irrevocably different from this day forward -- until the next time everything changes.  Adama made a mistake.  They all did.  And as he is wont to say, they will all have to live with it.</p>

<p><br />
"What is up with the pudgified Apollo? Too much chunky munky B&J? "</p>

<p>We're going to hint at some of the reasons for Lee's physical, er... changes in the first few episodes, then deal with it in more detail later.  Overall, we're going to be hinting at a lot of things that happened in the intervening year over the first few episodes, then do more stuff with it later, as the season progresses.</p>

<p><br />
"You have giant, steel balls. My head is still spinning from being smacked in the head with them in the form of Lay Down Your Burdens Part 2. It seems like you are operating under the philosophy that if the audience could possibly come up with a plot idea then it isn't good enough for BSG. Am I reading that right? I know I never would have guessed that we would suddenly jump 380 days ahead, but I love it. Will we get to see Tigh and Starbuck put all past hostility behind them and become a super bad ass resistance fighting duo with Anders, the chief, and Cally as their sidekicks? I'd like this not only because of the Tigh/Stabuck dynamic, but also because it would be nice to see Tigh do some good again. I loved the arc at the beginning of season two where all he could do was [censored] up while in command. However, since that point it seems that Tigh's only purpose for existing is to expose to the audience the wrong opinion or bad idea. Everything that comes out of his mouth is obviously the stupid or shortsighted answer which is invariable and immediately undercut by one of the wiser characters. He didn't like the documentary, the blackbird project... Have you noticed this theme? Personally I love Tigh and want him to be good for something again. Oh, and that first shot of him on New Caprica in that old man hat was priceless. Thanks. "</p>

<p>They're teflon, actually.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think you'll be happy to know that we've got some real meaty stuff planned for the Colonel in the first few episodes.  I also felt that we didn't use Tigh as effectively in the later part of Season Two, and I was eager to get him back into the thick of things.  He's got a sizable role in the initial episodes, and there are some enormous changes and shocks coming for his character next season.</p>

<p><br />
"What happened to Zarek? Given his help getting Baltar elected, I would have expected him to have recieved a pretty nice 'reward', perhaps as VP? Did Baltar even have a VP? We never see Zarek post-election or a year later on New Caprica. Given Zarak's penchant for political mayhem, I would think that his fate would be one of significant interest. Perhaps we will see this early in Season 3? "</p>

<p>You will be seeing Zarek again and early in the season.  He was the Vice President, but his relationship with Baltar went south relatively quickly, and he simply refused to cooperate once the Cylon occupation began.</p>

<p><br />
"Speaking of Directors - I think everyone has paid attention to the remarkable work the directors do on this show, albeit subconsciously. I was wondering about some specifics on how you developed the show's directorial conventions. I believe I read in AC that most scenes are shot with two cameras running. Given what was in your mission statment regarding the script, how much of that was instigated by Rymer and the other directors in terms of realizing that style and making BSG grounded in a semi documentary aesthetic? What conventions did they establish on the show that have surprised you?"</p>

<p>The documentary/verite approach was in the initial pitch I made to the studio and network, and it was something that David Eick and I had numerous conversations about in the lead-up to the miniseries.  It was a stylistic choice we made early on, and it colored all the conversations about the show with the production team, including the directors.  Michael Rymer then took this aesthetic approach and made it real, developed the visual language of the show and made concrete the ideas that David and I were tossing around.  The series bible does discuss the documentary film approach, but as always in this business, it's up to the man or woman behind the camera to make these things happen and Michael deserves a great deal of credit for the visuals we now take for granted.</p>

<p><br />
"I understand according to the podcast that you guys were way over budget on ep 2.20, but the tent city really threw me off. I try not to be one of those fans that nitpicks everything to death, but this bothered me so much that I had to register and post.  If they've been on planet for over a year now and they intend to make it their home, why are they still living in tents? If I had my choice between a tent and something more permanent and weatherproof, I'd be moving heaven and earth to construct the latter."</p>

<p>There are some permanent buildings in the settlement, but it seemed plausible that to start an entire city from scratch would be a massive undertaking to say the least.  It also seemed that without a strong leader like Laura Roslin to helm this kind of effort, that the organizational problems would add up and that the project could easily get stalled or delayed.  Now, add to that various unknowns like disease and unfamiliar weather patterns as well as the difficulties in exploiting the natural resources in a completely new environment, it didn't seem implausible that there'd still be a lot of people living in tents.  </p>

<p><br />
"Why is the fleet so concerned [about] elections? They are running for their lives, so I would think holding elections would be the least of their problems."</p>

<p>I felt right from the beginning that question of who was in charge and how a democratic society would deal with this situation was one of the fundamental questions of the show.  If democracy means anything, it means that people get to decide who their leaders are and what kind of life they choose to lead.  And the operative word is "choose."  Democracies are about choices, some made intelligently and thoughtfully, and some not so much.  Adama and the Galactica were faced with an immediate question as to the role of the military in this surviving population:  were they still the servants of the people, or were they the overseers?  Adama's choice was to preserve the idea of their society, indeed of their entire civilization while still striving to protect them from their enemies both within and without.  It was, and continues to be a difficult balancing act, but as he said in "Resurrection Ship":  it's not enough to survive, you have to worthy of suriving.</p>

<p>If the military simply took choice away from the people of the fleet, if it simply decided that the senior commanders knew best and that was that, then the people out there in those ships become irrelevant.  They're cargo.  It's a military world and a military society and everything else is secondary.  Down that road lies the cautionary tale of Admiral Cain and the battlestar Pegasus.  One Adama and Galactica decided not to go down that road, then the entire panoply of democracy was in play -- representation by consent and elections to determine those representatives.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Last week I had the privilege of being invited to speak at the annual Game Developers' Conference in San Jose and I have to say, it was an eye-opening experience.  I haven't been an active gamer in a long time, and it was startling to see how the industry has changed and matured.  </p>

<p>I grew up in the Classic Atari era, when a row of quarters on the Asteroids machine carried a great deal of credibility down at the bowling alley where I and the few video denizens of Chowchilla plied our trade.  I had the first home consoles as well, but after college I pretty much dropped out of gaming, with periodic forays into the burgeoning computer game market over the years.  My last effort involved buying an XBox a couple of years ago with the determination to get back into the game (pun intended) at last.  A week spent in frustration over my inability to master the multi-buttoned controller finally put to rest my dreams of mastering Max Payne and Madden NFL, and as Terry constantly reminds me, the XBox sits beneath the TV table in my office gathering dust.</p>

<p>That may have to change, however, after spending a few days at the GDC getting to know the people in the gaming business.  I was impressed, first of all, by the sheer brainpower which permeated the event and second of all with the maturity and seriousness of the business itself.  To put it succinctly:  these are seriously smart people, doing seriously smart things with a deadly seriousness of purpose.  When I walked the convention floor, I was struck by the intensity of the attendees as they browsed through the various booths and displays.  I'm told the event itself had discouraged the "babe booth" mentality long ago wherein scantily-clad women beckoned to the hormonally-challenged, and sadly, I saw no such relics from this storied past.  Instead, I found a lot of intense concentration and discussion of the latest software applications and character-building tools, upwards of ninety-five percent of which went sailing over my head.   </p>

<p>I was impressed with the the fact that this business was maturing right before my eyes and it was filled with people who wanted to push the bounds of their medium into new and exciting frontiers.  It was especially interesting to contrast the conversations I had with people in the gaming industry with the typical conversation with people in my own industry.  My industry tends toward the narcissistic, finding new and exciting ways to be in love with itself and its own hype, sometimes to the point of being in love with being in love with itself.  At the GDC, I found an almost uniformly skeptical and critical attitude toward the gaming business; a sense that they hadn't figured everything out yet, that anything you might like about games today was probably going to be obsolete very soon and a frustration level with the shortcomings and limitations of both the business model and the creative results.  For a business whose rise to billion-dollar status has been nothing if not meteoric, it was refreshing to see that the key movers and thinkers were restless and eager to move on, to find the next great idea and push the boundaries of the business to the next level.</p>

<p>I was treated well, with unfailing courtesy, and was gratified to find that many, many people there were fans of Galactica -- and more than one told me how they either were openly skeptical of the idea or didn't like the miniseries, but eventually came around to love the series.  I was a complete outsider at the event, a traveller from a distant land who barely spoke the language, but I never felt unwelcome.  With people like that involved in gaming, the future for video games is not only bright, it's probably blinding.</p>

<p>Now, if only I could figure out which button gets Dante to run the bootleg correctly...</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>"My question, why do the "marines" on the show always wear a CQB (close quarters battle) gear loadout in all the episodes? Even in the ones where they are outdoors? Is it possible we might see a different "marine" gear setup? "</p>

<p>It's primarily a budgetary issue.  We've got the CQB gear, so it's cheaper and easier to keep using it week after week than it is to rent specific items for every mission or to buy a wide variety of gear for stock.  There's also a costume issue in that we don't really have specific Marine uniforms, so we use variations of our existing "naval" uniforms for the Marines and distinguish them mostly through the use of the CQB gear.  </p>

<p><br />
"My question concerns Sharon's pregnancy. We know Helo is the father. Is Sharon the mother? That is, did Hera come from Sharon's egg, or were the eggs implanted in her from a human source? <br />
If so, isn't she just a surrogate womb and the Cylons don't really reproduce at all? Therefore the baby would still be totally human.<br />
If not, then how the heck did they manage to make her fertile, as female humans are *born* with all their eggs."</p>

<p>My assumption has been that the Cylons created Sharon's eggs and presumably the eggs for all Cylon females.  This could change, obviously, but the idea was that the Cylons were attempting to create a virtually perfect replica of the human form, right down to the reproductive system, but that they had been unable to actually reproduce on their own.</p>

<p><br />
"Ron, on another board we've been having a discussion about the comparisons between Galactica and Hill Street Blues, which just came out on DVD (Season One).  How much of a conscious foundation is HSB for BG?"</p>

<p>Hill Street Blues was definitely something of an archetype we looked to for developing the structure of the series.  I made explicit reference to the show in our series bible and talked about how we would strive to emulate their structure as much as possible.  That structure was, basically, to have a self-contained A-Story that would begin and end each week, with smaller character-centered B-Stories that would take place over a few episodes, and finally long-running C-Stories that would arc throughout the season.  It was a starting place for a lot of story discussions and script meetings, but we didn't strictly adhere to the form, as you can see from the experimentation we did throughout the first season.  The first seven episodes of season two roughly follow this format, but then we varied again from that structure for the rest of the season.  Why didn't we hew more closely to the Hill Street format?  Partly it's a result of not wanting the show to get so serialized as to be inaccessible to new viewers, and partly it's a result of continually wanting to try new things on the show and mix up the story-telling.</p>

<p><br />
"Why was it that Pegasus was able to escape given that it had networked computers? Seems odd. My theory is that the Pegasus is one huge trojan horse."</p>

<p>This will be explained in the longer version of "Pegasus" that'll be included in the Season Two DVD box set.  Essentially, Pegasus had her network off-line in preparation for going into the shipyard for an overhaul and wasn't vulnerable to that point of attack.</p>

<p><br />
"If (when?) working on the show becomes too stressful, are you able to notice and take a time-out? I bet it is easy to get caught up in the business, and therefore lose some of the art. How do you maintain the pleasure in the craft when your role also contains so much of the mechanics, business, and politics of creating TV?"</p>

<p>My wife is very focussed on making me chill out from time to time.  I tend to think about the show even when I'm not sitting down and working on it, and it does become all-consuming at times.  We try to go to the movies, but often end up camped in front of the TiVo or DVDs.  I read a lot -- there's a stack of books on my nightstand at the moment, everything from "The Age of Federalism," "The Assassins Gate" and "State of War" to "Vanilla Slim," "The March," and "Gravity's Rainbow," not all of which I've even started yet.  I coach my son's T-Ball team and I'm teaching my daughter basketball, both of which have the added benefit of making me get off my ass and do something physical.</p>

<p>As for maintaining the pleasure in the show itself, I find that it rarely wans, actually.  For all the struggles and arguments and politicking, I still get to see the words I write translated and improved by an incredibly talented production team and that joy never seems to go away.  There's an immense sense of accomplisment and pride in just stepping onto the soundstage or looking at artwork, or viewing dailies, or putting the film together, and it hasn't run out so far.  Hopefully, it never will.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Surfed through the official boards and saw a LOT of spoiler photos from the finale.  I'm not trying to be snarky, or ruin anyone's fun or trample anyone's speech, but I gotta say, I'm pretty disappointed that so much material is getting posted.  There's a lot of people who work really, really hard on the show who are waiting to see the finale and have the pleasure of surprising the audience and it's a bummer when it's ruined this close to the final airdate.  Obviously, people can do what they want, it's a free country but I'd really appreciate it if the photos posted so far were confined to that thread and if people resisted the temptation to post any more shots or any more plot details.  I've resisted going through the locked-down security regimes that the studios sometimes go through to protect material, but this is the kind of thing that could reverse that policy and make everything harder to access.</p>

<p>Thanks and enjoy the show. </p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>"I've never understood Roslin's rationale for wanting to abort Sharon's baby in "Epiphanies". Why did she see the hybrid baby as a threat to the fleet? Dr. Cottle mentioned that the blood sample was 'odd', but how does that translate to dangerous? I've never been able to appreciate this episode because I couldn't really understand the character's motivations."</p>

<p>The idea was that Laura saw the upcoming birth of the baby as representing a risk to the fleet.  She didn't know exactly what that risk was, but as Adama put it, "If it's good for the Cylons, then it's probably bad for us."  The complicating factor was that Laura knew she was dying and that the presidency was about to be turned over to Baltar, whose judgement and abilities she had grown to have less and less faith in over the course of time.  Faced with her seemingly imminent demise, Laura felt she couldn't gamble by leaving the decision of what to do with the child in the hands of Baltar and opted for the safer -- if harsher -- choice of aborting the child immediately.</p>

<p><br />
"How were you able to deal with ramping up to more episodes per season? I recall hearing that HBO's "The Wire" even had to take breaks to ease new writers into the fold. BSG has a different model, with ads and other pressures... Maybe we will we see more character studies, which are more contained within themselves?"</p>

<p>We did take a month long break in between eps 10 & 11 in order to catch up on scripts.  Doing 20 instead of 13 makes a big difference in terms of stamina and quality control.  When you're concentrating on 13, you can essentially make each of them special and each of them gets a lot of attention.  With 20, you're spreading yourself out more and trying to keep more balls in the air at once.  I won't say that's the only reason why we had a couple of shows that I wasn't happy with this season, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a contributing factor.</p>

<p><br />
"Is [the blonde woman lying on her back getting belly-button shots in "Scar"] Starbuck? There is some controversy over this question."</p>

<p>No it isn't and we struggled with it in the editing room to tweak her hair color and other things to make it clear that it wasn't her, but we never licked the problem.  We really wanted the shot because it directly ties into the flashback shot of Anders kissing her on the stomach, so we opted to keep it in rather than lose it altogether.</p>

<p><br />
"Will there be anymore episodes that reflect one from TOS? <br />
Also, I don't know if this has been asked yet but here it goes. In the mini series, part one before the attack, as Six and Baltar were leaving the Ministry of Defense, Six told Baltar that she was meeting somebody, a person/cylon walks up to her after Baltar leaves and Six says "I was wondering when you would show up". <br />
Who was she talking to??"</p>

<p>We don't have any plans for redoing any more episodes from the original series.  "Pegasus" was the one that translated the best and the others all seem too distant from our structure and universe.  </p>

<p>In the miniseries, the presumption was that Six was meeting with another humanoid Cylon on Caprica, and I was using that moment to do a cut to the original series Cylon aboard Galactica.  We've talked about various possibilities over the course of the last couple seasons as to who she might've been meeting with at that moment, but nothing's really grabbed us (although, there was a mad moment when we considered revealing that she was meeting with Laura!  We talked about working that in as the reveal in the "Epiphanies" flashbacks, but we couldn't come up with any rational justification for why Laura wouldn't have reacted to the Shelley Godfrey Cylon in "Six Degrees of Separation").</p>

<p><br />
"Thanks for a great show its one of my all time favorites. I have three questions. Why would Adama being an Admiral not change his flag to Pegasus which is arguably the most important and powerful ship in the fleet? When will 62 make it up on to the ships section of the web site i am curious to see her specs: size, weaps, ect. In the future will we have the honor of seeing some flashbacks to the 1st Cylon War? We only get the enjoyment of two Battlestars duking it out with Base Ships, it must have been quite a light and sound show when it was fleets. Of course it is probably out of the budget ballpark "</p>

<p>There's ample precedent for admirals to hoist their flags aboard vessels that are not necessarily the biggest and most powerful in the fleet.  Sometimes communications gear is better aboard less powerful ships or sometimes the flag officer just feels more comfortable and at home aboard a familiar ship.  Raymond Spruance, commander of the US Fifth Fleet in WWII, often kept his flag aboard the USS Indianapolis, a heavy cruiser, rather than one of the fleet's carriers or battleships simply because he used to command cruisers and felt more comfortable there.  (The Indianapolis, of course, was sunk late in the war by a Japanese submarine after delivering the atomic bomb to Tinian, but Spruance was not aboard.)  So Adama has kept his flag aboard Galactica because it's his ship and he doesn't want to move.</p>

<p>I don't know when or if they'll be putting the specs on Pegasus up on the website.  I hope so -- I'd like to see them myself.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>There are things you hear in childhood which imprint themselves on your heart, in your brain, and upon your soul.  </p>

<p>When I was a child, my parents used to take my brother and I twice a year to Disneyland.  The behemoth that is Disney today certainly doesn't need me to sing the praises of the happiest place on earth, so I'll spare you fond memories of vacation days spent journeying aboard the Submarine Voyage or Flight to the Moon.  However, I was recently downloading a compilation of soundtracks from the park and came across the original recording of Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, one of the first of the audio-animatronic shows that would become a defining characteristic of the theme park experience.</p>

<p>The original track presented a speech by Lincoln that was actually a compliation of several different speeches and writings by the sixteenth president and presented a robotic version of him delivering the oration against a handsome backdrop of the US Capitol building while accomapanied by appropriately stirring music.  The show was a particular favorite of mine and my father's, both for the theatrical experience and for the nakedly patriotic content of the speech itself.  The sentiments and the philosophy it expressed were no less riveting for the nakedly manipulative presentation and the venue in which they were showcased.  It was the kind of show that made you want to enlist in the armed forces on your way out the door (and if the Pentagon knew what it was doing, it would've had a booth in the exit lobby like the one in Times Square).  </p>

<p>Several years ago, the original speech was replaced by a more pedestrian reading of the Gettysburg Address, and I pretty much stopped going to the show, disappointed that a unique piece of work had been supplanted by something so familiar (if inarguably brilliant in its text).  But when I found a recording of the original speech and heard it for the first time in a long time, I was struck not only by the fact that something so well remembered could still touch and inspire me, but that the content of the speech itself was something I had so completely inhaled and made part of my political outlook, and also by the fact that Lincolns words seem particularly relevant now, during a time of tumult and debate over the role of the law in a time of national crisis and war.  </p>

<p>It's probably also worth noting that more than a little of the politics of Battlestar Galactica can be traced back to these passages originally written by the rail-splitter from Illinois:</p>

<p><br />
"The world has never had a good definition of the word 'liberty.'  The American people just now, are much in want of one.  We all declare for liberty.  But in using the same word, we do not all mean the same thing.  </p>

<p>"What constitutes the bulwark of our liberty and independence?  It is not our frowning battlements, our bristling seacoasts -- these are not our reliance against tyranny.  Our reliance is in the love of liberty, which God has planted in our bosom.  Our defence is in the preservation of the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men in all lands, everywhere.  Destroy this spirit and you have planted the seeds of despotism around your own door.  </p>

<p>"At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?  By what means shall we fortify against it?  Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow?  </p>

<p>"Never.  </p>

<p>"All the armies of Europe, Asia and Africa combined, could not, by force, take a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in a trial of a thousand years.  At what point then, is the approach of danger to be expected?  I answer that if it ever reach us, it must spring from amongst us; it cannot come from abroad.  If destruction be our lot, we ourselves must be the authors and finishers. </p>

<p>"As a nation of free men, we must live through our times or die by suicide.  Let reverence for the law be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap; let it be taught in the schools, in the seminaries and in the colleges; let it be written in primers, in spelling books and almanacs; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls and enforced in courts of justice; and in short, let it become the political religion of the nation.  And let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly at its altar.  And let us strive to deserve, as far as mortals may, the continued care of Divine Providence, trusting that in future national emergencies, He will not fail to provide us the instruments of safety and security.  </p>

<p>"Let us not be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the government, nor of dungeons to ourselves.  </p>

<p>"Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it."  </p>

<p>-- Abraham Lincoln</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>"Having watched Star Trek for many years, and now an avid Galactica watcher; I have noticed unlike the Star Trek shows of the past...we know little about how Galactica works. We don't know much about her engines at all, what powers the ship..weapons. Is this an intentional effort to steer Battlestar Galactica away from the technobabble Star Trek would often be muddled in and focus time exclusively on the characters of the show? Will we learn and see more of Galactica in the future?"</p>

<p>It's a pretty deliberate choice not to reveal very much about the technical specs on Galactica.  Partly it's a way to clear out a great deal of technobabble that tends to swamp action scenes and leach drama from what should be intense moments, and partly it's a way of preserving flexibility in terms of storytelling.  The more we define the capabilities of the ship, the more we limit ourselves in terms of exactly what the ship can and cannot do in a given situation.  Now, you can't really avoid establishing parameters as the show develops and having some sense of the limitations is a good thing to maintain continuity, but a little of it goes a long way.</p>

<p>"I got a quick question that may have been asked...but I was wondering what plans (if any) you have for Boxey? Now that Sharon's been killed...is he living alone? With Lee? With Kara? In an airlock? Any plans to develop him more or was he just a throwback to the original???"</p>

<p>Boxey is currently seeking his lost daggit and won't return until he finds it.</p>

<p>"With the US State of the Union [last] night, I was wondering whether or not Madame President gives anything similar on the state of the colonies - are we getting more politics a la "Colonial Day"? Maybe some elections soon? Your podcasts have seemed to indicate that we might . . ."</p>

<p>I don't know if there's an equivalent to the State of the Union or not, it's something to think about for the future.  However, there will definitely be more political intrigue this season, leading up to the presidential election itself -- which is going to be a doozy.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>"Are the Centurions sentient? If so, does their memory get uploaded to a new body when they die?"</p>

<p>No, the centurions are not sentient and their memories/experiences are not downloaded into new bodies when they die.</p>

<p>"Why does every one call the officers Sir even if they are women? I was in the military but I thought that every one knows to call female officers or presidents Mam."</p>

<p>This was something I took from Wrath of Khan.  In that film, everyone called Saavik "sir" and I liked the way it played and the implication that the honorific had become gender neutral at that point.  On Next Generation, we didn't encounter a point where a female officer had to be addressed with a "sir" or ma'am" until well into the run -- an embarassing moment for the entire writing staff, by the way -- and it started a fair amout of debate about which one should be used to address Troi during a crisis (I believe the episode was "Disaster").  My personal feeling was that there was something vaguely condescending about "Yes, ma'am" versus "Yes, sir" in context and that by addressing everyone as "sir" it made a point about the egalitarian nature of Starfleet.  It's certainly a debatable point, and Jeri Taylor, the executive producer running the writing staff at that point, felt very differently about it.  Ultimately, we decided to go with "sir" and follow the protocol from Wrath of Khan.  When I was writing the miniseries for Galactica, I decided I wanted to use sir for all the female characters and I even toyed briefly with the idea of calling Laura "Mister President" but that seemed like a step too far.  Billy does call Laura "ma'am" on occasion, so the term itself does exist in the Galactica universe, but the military invariably calls her "sir."</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I've seen some speculation out there that we dropped the Cylon POV episode from the lineup this season, but I'm happy to report that it's untrue.  The episode, "Downloaded" will be broadcast as number 18 and I just watched it last night.  It's a good show and a very different spin on our story thus far, in that we're telling the A-story entirely through the eyes of the Cylons for the first time.  This was something that I'd been wanting to do for a long time but it took a while to come to fruition.  The confusion probably came from the fact that we had initially planned to do a clip show as ep 18, but then dropped those plans once we made the decision to split "Resurrection Ship" into two parts, thereby giving us an extra episode and obviating the need for the clip show (which was being planning for budgetary reasons).</p>

<p>Some confusion out there about why Roslin didn't simply promote Adama over Cain at the start of all the trouble or try to relieve the wacky admiral herself.  My reasoning was that Cain would never accept it, especially since her acquiesence to Laura's authority as president was shaky at best.  Laura should be smart enough to know that Cain wasn't the kind of person who could be taken down by a legalism and so she shouldn't give an order that she knows will be disobeyed, thereby undercutting her own position as president.  There used to be a line to that effect in the script, but it got cut over the course of the rewrites.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Hey look at that -- two blogs on the same day.  </p>

<p>Alert the press.</p>

<p>"Firstly, what lead you to choose Zoic studios, and secondly, how does your studio interact with Zoic? I can understand how that would all go over in a MOVIE, but in a SHOW where you have (essentially) a 45 minute movie EVERY WEEK, how do you get the shots that you want, then get them edited the way you want them? (Sorry, student films have 0 effects budget, so I've never worked with them."</p>

<p>Zoic was chosen for the miniseries after we examined several other houses and VFX artists.  I was producing Carnivale for HBO at the time the final decision was made, but I believe that Gary Hutzel, our Visual Effects Supervisor and the man most responsible for the VFX of the show overall, strongly recommended using them based on their past work and their presentation.  </p>

<p>Gary is the primary conduit between the VFX houses (and we do use other houses in addition to Zoic) and the show.  Gary's involved in every episode right from the beginning of the process -- sometimes the writers are talking to him even before an episode is written in order to gauge the producibility (if that's a word) of what  we're contemplating.  For instance, we had numerous conversations with Gary regarding "Scar" (ep 15) which has a great deal of fighter combat in the show and we wanted to start talking with him early to get a sense of how to construct the episode so we could get the most bang for our buck.  We also rely on Gary to help us "balance" the shows so that an expensive VFX show like "Scar" can be offset by pulling way back on VFX shots in a show that is less dependent on them like "Black Market."</p>

<p>Gary and his team are counting shots and coming up with rough guesstimates on budgets from the first writer's draft, and are intensely involved in the entire production process.  We have dedicated meetings with just the VFX team throughout pre-production and Gary is often on the set during the shoot itself to go over the various green-screen elements needed to be shot. </p>

<p>Once the show is in the can (or rather the cartridge) the editor and the director collaborate on carving an initial cut of the episode and they slug in places for missing VFX shots.  It used to be that you'd go through the entire editorial process with nothing but cards saying "Shot Missing --VFX."  That was the way it was done when I did Trek; entire battle seqeunces were constructed only after the show had been locked and the editorial rhythms established.  Today, the CGI artists will provide "previz" -- previsualsations -- giving rough animatics of the entire action.  The editors, directors and producers play around with the placement and duration of the previz shots, often asking for changes in the shots or asking for new ones or dumping them entirely from the show.  The entire process is complicated by the calendar, in that shows done early in the season have more time in Post and thus can be changed and monkeyed around with more than shows done late in the season which are closer to their airdates.</p>

<p>Gary is constantly battling to get David and I to sign off on VFX shots as early as possible to give his team enough time to complete them for air, and David and I are constantly battling to tweak the shots just "one more time."  It's a long, difficult process and the fact that we have the best effects on television today (in my well informed opinion) is a testament to Gary's tireless efforts and the dedication of everyone involved on his team.</p>]]>

<title>Is it really Season Three?</title>

<![CDATA[<p>Somehow, I'm sitting here working on the third season of Galactica and yet Post Production has this annoying habit of reminding me that I'm still not finished with the second.  (Note to self:  fire everyone in Post.)</p>

<p>I can state with some confidence that everyone 'round the old battlestar is pretty excited about the end of the second season and where we begin the third.  We've got the first four stories approved by the network, we're working on the next two, and this week I'm supposed to start writing the first script (yikes).  </p>

<p>While the end of the first season also had us all jazzed about the finale, we were less certain when it came to the beginning of the second.  Partly that was a result of not having aired any of the year one shows when we started working on the next season and didn't have a great deal of certainty when it came to the true audience reaction and ratings and partly it was a result of having spread our characters out over such a large story in the finale that we knew it was going to take a long time to sew everything back together again.  This time, we have a lot more experience under our belts and we have the added benefit of looking back on season two and learning where we could improve.</p>

<p>So this time around, we're kicking off the new season with genuine excitement, and even though the production start-up date is mind-numbingly close, there's a lot of confidence in the air and not a lot of burn-out looming -- which stuns me most of all.</p>

<p>And yeah, I'm blogging again.  Let's see how quickly I can get back on this horse.</p>]]>
