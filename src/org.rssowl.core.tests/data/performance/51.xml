<p>"TOMORROWLAND: CalArts in Moving Pictures" is an ambitious film program (curated by Josh Siegel) that aims to document the work of CalArts animation and live-action student filmmakers. It opens tomorrow at MoMA in New York and runs through August 13. A complete schedule of film programs and screening times can be found <A HREF="http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/film_media/2006/CalArts.html">HERE</A>. The rare student works of many of today's most well known animation artists will be shown including Henry Selick, Paul Demeyer, Stephen Hillenburg, Craig McCracken, Kathy Rose, Joanna Priestley, Nancy Beiman, Jorgen Klubien, Gary Conrad, Chris Sanders, David Daniels, Eric Darnell and JJ Villard. There's also a "School of Pixar" screening showcasing the CalArts films of individuals now working at Pixar including John Lasseter, Pete Docter (his film WINTER is at the top of this post), Joe Ranft, Andrew Stanton, Brenda Chapman, Ralph Eggleston, Doug Sweetland and Mark Andrews. An article about the show appeared last week in the <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/movies/21darg.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1">NY TIMES</A> (use <A HREF="http://www.bugmenot.com">BugMeNot</A> to bypass registration).<P></p>

<p>And speaking of CalArts student films, below  you can watch one that's not on the MoMA program—BABY'S NEW FORMULA by cartoon genius Aaron Springer. It's a bit crude in terms of content, so watch at your own risk.<P></p>

This first volume reprints, in color, Kelly's comic book work from 1942 and 1943 and is printed on a nice smooth/thick paper stock. Leonard's appreciation, and an intro by Kelly historian Steve Thompson, really put this early work in perspective - both Kelly's work for Western Publishing, and Our Gang's literary history. Kelly wrote and drew these comics shortly after leaving Disney and moving back east, and it's fun to see his take on Spanky, Buckwheat, Mickey (Robert Blake) and Froggy - especially during the war years, the last days of the MGM shorts series. Oh, and Jeff Smith (of "Bone") also contributed a great cover.<p>The other book Leonard showed me isn't available on Amazon.com, Disneyland, nor at your local bookstore. And yet it's published by Disney Editions and anyone can purchase it - if you know how. <a TARGET="_blank" href="http://disney.go.com/inside/yearbook/index.html?CMP=ILC-insyearbook&POS=hprollover">Disney Insider Yearbook 2005</a> is an interesting publication aimed at hard-core Disney buffs. <TABLE Align=right><TR><TD><img alt="disneyinsider.jpg" src="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/archives/disneyinsider.jpg" width="244" height="335" ALIGN=right></TD></TR></TABLE>Apparently, the folks who published  the now defunct <i>Disney Magazine</i> have rounded up their writers to create a special annual limited-edition book, packed with unique articles on different aspects of Disney history - yesterday, today and tomorrow. Twenty six heavily illustrated articles are featured, including Leslie Iwerks on Pixar, Charles Solomon on the artists behind BAMBI, Paula Sigmond Lowery on the new Walt Disney Family Library currently under construction on San Francisco, Brenda Chapman and Mike Gabriel offer tributes to  Joe Grant and Joe Ranft, and Leonard Maltin discussing the Disney Treasures "Rarities" DVD. Other notable contributors to this volume include David R. Smith, Jim Fanning, Brian Sibley, Jeff Kurtti and Tim O'Day.<p>It's over 170 color glossy pages of material that really adds to your Disney I.Q. There is a softcover version available for $24.95 or a hardcover edition (which comes with a limited edition lithograph and a bonus DVD of stuff) for $49.95. More information, and ordering instructions are located <a TARGET="_blank" href="http://disney.go.com/inside/yearbook/index.html?CMP=ILC-insyearbook&POS=hprollover">here</a>.<br />

It's an interesting mix of styles (Toby's lush watercolor late-1930s feel combined with the grittier early-30s Fleischer). Not all the pieces are displayed online, so a trip to the gallery is worth it. (And they have some killer original pieces from Warner Bros. and Disney.)<br />

      <![CDATA[<p>We've had some crazy ideas before here at Cartoon Brew, but this one may top them all. We're having a contest to find a Guest Brewer, somebody who will blog right alongside the Brewmasters—Jerry Beck and Amid Amidi. Anybody can enter—animators, fans, directors, historians, board artists, executives—if you like the Brew and feel you have something interesting to say, we want to hear from you. The winner will receive a two-week gig on the Brew. Now here's where it gets interesting. At the end of two weeks, the entire Cartoon Brew readership will get to vote on whether the Guest Brewer can continue blogging or not. If so, our Guest Brewer gets another two-week term, if not, we introduce the next Guest Brewer.<P></p>

<p>Why are we doing this? Because while we both love discussing the art and craft of animation, we know that we're not the only passionate voices out there. By doing this, we hope to encourage new voices in the animation blogging community and bring to light different points of view about the art form. Plus, we think it can be a lot of fun. If you're interested, simply send an email to <B>cartoonbrewer [at] yahoo.com</B>. Tell us (briefly) why you should be our Guest Brewer. Tell us your areas of expertise and give a sense of the topics you'll be writing about. This is such an untested idea that we don't quite know how we'll be judging this yet. We simply want to hear from passionate voices in the community and give them exposure on the Brew. Convince us that you're going to be the best Brewer. Entries will be accepted until noon on Thursday, May 25. We'll announce a winner here on Friday, May 26.<br />

<p>Here's the <A HREF="http://www.princessmovie.com/dk/trailer_stor.htm">TRAILER</A> for PRINCESS, a new hand-drawn animation/live-action feature from Denmark directed by <A HREF="http://www.wulffmorgenthaler.com/">Anders Morgenthaler</A>. The film is playing at Cannes this month. The synopsis, from the film's <A HREF="http://www.princessmovie.com/">official website</A>, makes it clear that this is a very different type of animated film:<P></p>

<p><BLOCKQUOTE>The 32-year-old clergyman August returns home from years of missionary work abroad because of the death of his sister Christina, who – after going from greatness to the gutter as the famous porno star ”The Princess” - has finally died of drug abuse. She has left her five-year-old daughter Mia with Karen, a prostitute. August pays them a visit to bring Mia home with him and become her guardian. Burdened by sorrow and guilt, he decides to avenge Christina’s death and brings Mia along on a crusade to clear his sister’s name of pornographic connotations. The mission escalates into a brutal and violent rout as August attempts desperately to protect the only thing he holds dear – namely Mia – forcing him to make a fateful decision.</BLOCKQUOTE><P></p>

<p>While in the US, audiences have resigned themselves to accepting one 'farting animal' CG film after another, there is a mini-renaissance of mature, intelligent feature animation currently being produced in Europe, including PRINCESS, as well as Norway's <A HREF="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/archives/2006_02.html#001664">FREE JIMMY</A>, and France's <A HREF="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/archives/2006_02.html#001624">PEUR[S] DU NOIR</A> and <A HREF="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/archives/2006_01.html#001549">RENAISSANCE</A>. <br />

<p>HALAS AND BATCHELOR CARTOONS: AN ANIMATED HISTORY is a new coffeetable book coming out in August that is "part-history, part-tribute, part-critical analysis of the Halas and Batchelor Cartoon Studio," a studio that existed in Britain for over fifty years (1940-1995). The studio was most famously responsible for ANIMAL FARM, the first British full-length animated feature, but they produced hundreds of other quality films, commercials and TV series as well. The book is co-written by animation scholar Paul Wells and Vivien Halas, daughter of studio founders John Halas and Joy Batchelor. According to the book's press release, additional insights are offered by John Canemaker, Giannalberto Bendazzi and Richard Hollis. The book seems to only be available for pre-order at <A HREF="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1904915175">Amazon UK</A> at the moment, but hopefully it'll receive some US distribution as well. After this, I hope  somebody will write a book about Britain's other great animation outfit—W.M. Larkins Studio. Now there's a studio that has received virtually no recognition in history books, even though they produced unbelievably cool films and commercials from the 1940s-1960s, and had a roster of superb artists working there including Peter Sachs, Philip Stapp, Bob Godfrey and Richard Taylor.<br />
