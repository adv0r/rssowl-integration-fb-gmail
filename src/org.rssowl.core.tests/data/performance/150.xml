        <summary>This is pretty cool. It turns out you can freeze water at room temperature, creating so-called hot ice. There are at least two known methods for doing this. Hot ice effectively transforms water into a solid that is like a form of glue. This opens the door for some interesting potential applications -- including using water to seal food packaging (instead of chemical glues), using water to seal leaks in ships, tunnels and pipes (imagine self-healing hulls and pipes that use water to seal leaks), and perhaps even using water to destroy cancer cells -- the potential applications are endless....</summary>

Understanding The Value Of Associative Thinking In A World Of Linear Decision-Making </em></p>

<p>
Decisions and communications among individuals in organizations are
frequently initiated, managed and concluded almost entirely from within
a framework of linear-logical thinking. Paradoxically, the products and
services comprising the intellectual property and capital creative upon
which most business are founded owe their existence to a non-linear,
but nonetheless logical, syncretic process of associative thinking.
Syncretic thinking is a mental process that makes non-linear, and
therefore often unexpected, connections among seemingly divergent
phenomena or data on the basis of common qualities.</p>

<p>By understanding this paradox between the creative syncretic process
characterizing the founding stage of an organization, and the
conservative linear processes that characterize later stages we can
generate a new mix of creative thinking that effectively includes both
elements. These two modes of thought highlight several differences
between the mind-sets that typify the young innovative start-up phase
of a business compared with that same business at a later more mature
phase, settled into it’s niche. The associative and inventive thinking
that generated a novel product or service and founded an organization
or industry may, at maturity, have yielded to a more rigorous calculus
of risk, competition and strategic analysis. In this later phase of
organization, linear frameworks of thinking that tend to conserve
capital and to advance the organizations goals incrementally within an
established niche are strongly reinforced and rewarded. Thus linearity,
alone, is widely believed to be essential for survival. However,
neither framework in isolation is likely to encourage the growth of new
ideas that may form the future of the organization. Nor could an
organization develop far beyond the initial concept stage without the
benefit of both modalities operating together.</p></blockquote>

If you press your head tightly against the casing you can hear these vibrations -- which are actual cell phone calls. When you speak it sends resonance back through the shielding which scatters the reflected microwaves to the frequency of your voice, which are then received back into the microwave, acting as modulators of the carrier wave of the emitter, which effectively broadcasts what you are saying across a range of microwave frequencies at once. <a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/aprilfool/">Click here to read the </a><a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/aprilfool/">paper.</a> </p>

        <summary>Researchers continue to make progress in fusing living neurons with computer chips:The line between living organisms and machines has just become a whole lot blurrier. European researchers have developed neuro-chips in which living brain cells and silicon circuits are coupled together. The achievement could one day enable the creation of sophisticated neural prostheses to treat neurological disorders or the development of organic computers that crunch numbers using living neurons. To create the neuro-chip, researchers squeezed more than 16,000 electronic transistors and hundreds of capacitors onto a silicon chip just 1 millimeter square in size. They used special proteins found in the brain to glue brain cells, called neurons, onto the chip. However, the proteins acted as more than just a simple adhesive. They also provided the link between ionic channels of the neurons and semiconductor material in a way that neural electrical signals could be passed to the silicon chip, said study team member Stefano Vassanelli from the University of Padua in Italy. The proteins allowed the neuro-chip&apos;s electronic components and its living cells to communicate with each other. Electrical signals from neurons were recorded using the chip&apos;s transistors, while the chip&apos;s capacitors were used to stimulate the neurons.From:...</summary>

        <summary>Japanese cell phone company KDDI is offering a new GPS-enabled 3D navigational tool to their 17 million subscribers (see article and picture). Their system helps consumers navigate city streets and even within buildings, using an innovative 3D map and audio directions. This system is similar to (but possibly more advanced than) the in-car navigation systems we are familiar with, such as Hertz Neverlost or the Magellan products (note: I have a Magellan aftermarket nav system in my car -- it&apos;s one of the most useful things I ever bought!). GPS-enabled mobile devices and the location-aware services they enable are definitely a Next Big Thing contender. They have many compelling potential uses in the near-term and mid-term future. Below are some of my wild speculations on how this technology could be used: Personal navigation. Your device can help you find your way when walking, driving, or even on the water or in the wilderness. Location-aware advertising. Your device can get special offers from stores near you, as you walk or drive around, according to your permissions, preferences and profile of course. Location-aware storage, search and retrieval. Your device remembers where you were when you wrote a note, took a photo, or sent a message.You can later search for your stuff based on where you were -- for example, photos I took in Brazil or Notes I made at PC Forum in 2006 (for the best example of this, see the amazing product, EverNote -- the next version of which I got to preview recently, it is mind-blowingly cool!).

<p>GPS-enabled mobile devices and the location-aware services they enable are definitely a &quot;Next Big Thing&quot; contender.&nbsp; They have many compelling potential uses in the near-term and mid-term future. Below are some of my wild speculations on how this technology could be used:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Personal navigation</strong>. Your device can help you find your way when walking, driving, or even on the water or in the wilderness.</li>

<li><strong>Location-aware advertising</strong>. Your device can get special offers from stores near you, as you walk or drive around, according to your permissions, preferences and profile of course.</li>

Your device remembers where you were when you wrote a note, took a photo, or sent a message.You can later search for your stuff based on where you were -- for example, &quot;photos I took in Brazil&quot; or &quot;Notes I made at PC Forum in 2006&quot; (for the best example of this, see the amazing product, <a href="http://www.evernote.com/en/">EverNote</a> -- the next version of which I got to preview recently, it is mind-blowingly cool!).</li>

<li><strong>Location-aware photo-enhancement</strong>. When you take a photograph it is not only tagged with time and location where it was taken, but the content of the photo can be automatically tagged based on the orientation of the camera. For example, if you take a photo of the Empire State Building, your camera will someday be able to tag the photo as being about the Empire State Building, and can even detect and tag the shape of the building itself in the photo.</li>

<li><strong>Location-aware social networking</strong>. Your device can track people nearby who are your friends, family, colleagues, or who match your interests and want to meet you (for example: dating). This can be useful to find people at a crowded event, or to hook up with your friends while out on the town, or to meet people at a trade show or conference.</li>

<li><strong>Location-aware personal security</strong>. Your device can keep a transcript of your movements on a server. Parties you authorize can track you if they need to find you immediately, or in case you go missing. In addition, bulk alerts can be sent to people who happen to be in particular areas -- for example, if a tornado is coming, people who happen to be in that vicinity can be warned.</li>

<li><strong>Location-aware information services</strong>. You can get news and other local info about the place you happen to be in. If you are standing outside a restaurant you can see reviews and discussions from people who have been there before. If you are already in the restaurant you can see recommendations of what to order from people who were there before you. Information can be virtually posted to particular places or regions -- you can hang a virtual post it note in your doorway so that anyone who passes through it gets the note.</li></ul></div>]]>

        <summary>Today I read an interesting article in the New York Times about a company called Rite-Solutions which is using a home-grown stock market for ideas to catalyze bottom-up innovation across all levels of personnel in their organization. This is a way to very effectively harness and focus the collective creativity and energy in an organization around the best ideas that the organization generates. Using virtual stock market systems to measure community sentiment is not a new concept but it is a new frontier. I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve even scratched the surface of what this paradigm can accomplish. For lots of detailed links to resources on this topic see the wikipedia entry on prediction markets. This prediction markets portal also has collected interesting links on the topic. Here is an informative blog post about recent prediction market attempts. Here is a scathing critique of some prediction markets. There are many interesting examples of prediction markets on the Web: Google uses a similar kind of system -- their own version of a prediction market -- to enable staff members to collaboratively predict the likelihood that various internal projects and events will occur on-schedule. Yahoo also has a prediction market called BuzzGame that enables visitors to help predict technology trends. Newsfutures Exchange is a prediction market about the news, which is powered by a commercial prediction market engine sold by a company called Newsfutures. BlogShares, a fantasy stock market for Weblogs in which players invest virtual money in the blogs they think will gain the most audience share. Intrade is another exchange for trading on idea futures. The Iowa Political Futures Exchange is a prediction market that focuses on political change.

<p>Another area that is related, but highly underleveraged today, are ways to enable communities to help establish whether various ideas are correct using argumentation. By enabling masses of people to provide reasons to agree or disagree with ideas, and with those reasons as well, we can automatically rate what ideas are most agreed with or disagreed with. One very interesting example of this is <a href="http://www.truthmapping.com">TruthMapping.com.</a> Some further concepts related to this approach are discussed <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/ideastockexchange/">in this thread.</a></p>

        <summary>Yesterday, the first public open-source release of Open IRIS was annnounced. IRIS is a Java-based desktop semantic personal information manager developed by SRI (with help from my own company, Radar Networks -- we provided a some of our early semantic object libraries and a native triplestore, and some work on UI; note that our own upcoming products, and our semantic applications platform, are quite different from IRIS and focused on different needs, however), as part of the DARPA CALO program. IRIS provides a rich semantic web based environment for desktop personal knowledge management across activities, applications and types of information. This release is primarily for semantic web and AI researchers for now -- in other words, it&apos;s still early-stage software (not intended for end-user consumers...yet) -- but for researchers IRIS provides what may be the most comprehensive, robust development platform for building next-generation learning applications that help people work with their desktop information more productively. If you&apos;re interested in a practical example of how the semantic web looks and feels on the desktop, see the information on the Open IRIS site, or if you&apos;re a bit more of a geek, download it and try it yourself.

        <summary>Chinese officials are preparing to strike hard against civil unrest. Are they planning another Tiannamen-style massacre? There is something fundamentally wrong with a government that has to torture, repress, and murder it&apos;s own people (and its neighboring peoples) on a regular, systematic basis in order to maintain stability. China isn&apos;t the only country guilty of such crimes, but they are certainly the most visible. As one of the largest, and most important, nations on earth -- and as a key member of the global community -- China really should hold itself to a different standard. Just because protestors are comprised of disenfranchised peasants, workers, students and ethnic minorities does not mean that their lives and causes are without value. In fact, the whole point of the Maoist revolution was ostensibly to liberate the lower classes from oppression -- so I find it very ironic that the regime that grew out of that revolution is now actively oppressing the very same people it was formed to liberate. Worse still is that the Chinese government -- with or without Google&apos;s support -- cannot possibly succeed at a policy of repression in the long-term. Eventually, the more acts of violence that are perpetrated against the Chinese people, the more disillusioned those people will become. And eventually the regime will fall out of favor and be dissolved. Since that is the inevitable outcome of the current direction of Chinese policy, why not just spare the needless loss of life, and take a different approach now? The Chinese government should find a way to listen to its people and work with them to build partnerships and solutions from the bottom-up instead of forcing them to comply from the top-down. Anyway, what I say doesn&apos;t matter -- I&apos;m sure the Chinese government is not reading this...</summary>

<![CDATA[<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
<span style="font-size: 1.4em;"><strong><u>Introduction:</u></strong></span><br /><br />
This article proposes the creation of a new open, nonprofit service on the Web
that will provide something akin to “collective self-awareness” back to the
Web. This service is like a &quot;Google Zeitgeist&quot; on steroids, but with a
lot more real-time, interactive, participatory data, technology and features in
it. The goal is to measure and visualize the state of the collective mind of
humanity, and provide this back to humanity in as close to real-time as is possible,
from as many data sources as we can handle -- as a web service. </p>

<p>By providing
this service, we will enable higher levels of collective intelligence to emerge
and self-organize on the Web. The key to collective intelligence (or any
intelligence in fact) is self-awareness. Self-awareness is, in essence, a feedback loop in
which a system measures its own internal state and the state of its
environment, then builds a representation of that state, and then reasons about
and reacts to that representation in order to generate future behavior. This
feedback loop can be provided to any intelligent system -- even the Web, even humanity as-a-whole. If we
can provide the Web with such a service, then the Web can begin to “see itself” and
react to its own state for the first time. And this is the first step to
enabling the Web, and humanity as-a-whole, to become more collectively intelligent.</p>

<p>It should be noted that by
&quot;self-awareness&quot; I don’t mean consciousness or sentience –
I think that the consciousness comes from humans at this point and we are not trying to synthesize it (we don't need to; it's already there). Instead, by &quot;self-awareness&quot; I mean
a specific type of feedback loop -- a specific Web service -- that provides a mirror of the state of the whole back to its parts. The parts are the conscious elements of the system – whether humans
and/or machines – and can then look at this meta-mirror to understand the whole as well
as their place in it. By simply providing this meta-level mirror, along with
ways that the individual parts of the system can report their state to it, and get
the state of the whole back from it, we can enable a richer feedback loop between the
parts and the whole. And as soon as this loop exists the entire system suddenly
can and will become much more collectively intelligent.</p>

<p>What I am proposing is something quite common in artificial intelligence. For example, in the field of robotics, such as when building an autonomous robot. Until a robot is provided with a means by which it can sense its
own internal state and the state of its nearby environment, it cannot behave
intelligently or very autonomously. But once this self-representation and feedback loop is
provided, it can then react to it’s own state and environment and suddenly can
behave far more intelligently. All cybernetic systems rely on this basic design pattern. I’m simply proposing we implement something like this for the
entire Web and the mass of humanity that is connected to it. It's just a larger application of an existing pattern. Currently people
get their views of “the whole” from the news media and the government – but these
views suffer from bias, narrowness, lack of granularity, lack of real-time data, and the fact that they are one-way, top-down services with no feedback loop capabilities. Our global collective self-awareness -- in order to be truly useful and legitimate really must be two-way, inclusive, comprehensive, real-time and democratic. In the global collective awareness, unlike traditional media, the view of
the whole is created in a bottom-up, emergent fashion from the sum of the reports from all the parts (instead of
just a small pool of reporters or publishers, etc.). </p>





<p class="MsoPlainText">The system I
envision would visualize the state of the global mind on a number of key
dimensions, in real-time, based on what people and software and organizations that
comprise its “neurons” and “regions” report to it (or what it can figure out by
mining artifacts they create). For example, this system would discover and rank
the current most timely and active topics, current events, people, places,
organizations, events, products, articles, websites, in the world right now. From
these topics it would link to related resources, discussions, opinions, etc. It
would also provide a real-time mass opinion polling system, where people could start
polls, vote on them, and see the results in real-time. And it would provide real-time
statistics about the Web, the economy, the environment, and other key
indicators.</p>
<p>The idea is to try to visualize the global mind – to make it
concrete and real for people, to enable them to see what it is thinking, what
is going on, and where they fit in it – and to enable them to start adapting
and guiding their own behavior to it. By giving the parts of the system more
visibility into the state of the whole, they can begin to self-organize
collectively which in turn makes the whole system function more intelligently
</p>

<p>Essentially I am proposing the
creation of the largest and most sophisticated mirror ever built – a mirror
that can reflect the state of the collective mind of humanity back to itself.
This will enable an evolutionary process which eventually will result in humanity
becoming more collectively self-aware and intelligent as-a-whole (instead of what it is today
-- just a set of separeate interacting intelligent parts). By providing such a service, we can catalyze the evolution
of higher-order meta-intelligence on this planet -- the next step in human
evolution. Creating this system is a grand cultural project of profound social
value to all people on earth, now and in the future.</p>

<p>This proposal calls for creating a nonprofit orgnaization to build and host this service as a major open-source initiative on the Web, like the Wikipedia, but with a very different user-experience and focus. It also calls for implementing the system with a hybrid central and distributed architecture. Although this vision is big, the specific technologies, design patterns, and features that are necessary to implement it are quite specific and already exist. They just have to be integrated, wrapped and rolled out. This will require an extraordinary and multidisciplanary team. If you're interested in getting involved and think you can contribute resources that this project will need, let me know (see below for details).</p><br />

<p><span style="font-size: 1.4em;"><u><strong>Further Thoughts<br /><br /></strong></u></span></p>


<p>Today I re-read this beautiful, visionary article by Kevin Kelley, about <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0629.html">the birth of the global mind</a>, in which he states:</p>
<blockquote><div class="TeaserText">The planet-sized &quot;Web&quot; computer is already more
complex than a human brain and has surpassed the 20-petahertz threshold
for potential intelligence as calculated by Ray Kurzweil. In 10 years,
it will be ubiquitous. So will superintelligence emerge on the Web, not
a supercomputer?</div></blockquote><p>Kevin's article got me thinking once again about an idea that has been on my mind for over a decade. I have often thought that the Web is growing into the collective nervous system of our species. This will in turn enable the human species to function increasingly as an intelligent superorganism, for example, like a beehive, or an ant colony -- but perhaps even more intelligent. But the key to bringing this process about is self-awareness. In short, the planetary supermind cannot become truly intelligent until it evolves a form of collective self-awareness. Self-awareness is the most critical component of human intelligence -- the sophistication of human self-awareness is what makes humans different from dumb machines, and from less intelligent species. </p>

<p>The Big Idea that I have been thinking about for over a decade is that if we can build something that functions like a collective self-awareness, then this could catalyze a huge leap in collective intelligence that would essentially &quot;wake up&quot; the global supermind and usher in a massive evolution in its intelligence and behavior. As the planetary supermind becomes more aware of its environment, its own state, and its own actions and plans, it will then naturally evolve higher levels of collective intelligence around this core. This evolutionary leap is of unimaginable importance to the future of our species.<br /> </p>



<p>In order for the collective mind to think and act more intelligently it must be able to sense itself and its world, and reason about them, with more precision -- it must have a form of self-awareness. The essence of self-awareness is self-representation -- the ability to sense, map,&nbsp; reason about, and react to, one's own internal state and the state of one's nearby environment. In other words, self-awareness is a feedback loop by which a system measures and reacts to its own self-representations. Just as is the case with the evolution of individual human intelligence, the evolution of more sophisticated collective human intelligence will depend on the emergence of better collective feedback loops and self-representations. By enabling a feedback loop in which information can flow in both directions between the self-representations of individuals and a meta-level self-representation for the set of all individuals, the dynamics of the parts and the whole become more closely coupled. And when this happens, the system can truly start to adapt to itself intelligently, as a single collective intelligence instead of a collection of single intelligences.</p>

<p>In summary, in order to achieve higher levels of collective intelligence and behavior, the global mind will first need something that functions as its collective self-awareness -- something that enables the parts to better sense and react to the state of the whole, and the whole to better sense and react to the state of its parts. What is needed essentially is something that functions as a collective analogue to a self -- a global collective self.</p>

<p>Think of the global self as a vast mirror, reflecting the state of the global supermind back to itself. Mirrors are interesting things. At first they merely reflect, but soon they begin to guide decisionmaking. By simply providing humanity with a giant virtual mirror of what is going on across the minds of billions of individuals, and millions of groups and organizations, the collective mind will crystallize, see itself for the first time, and then it will begin to react to its own image. And this is the beginning of true collective cognition. When the parts can see themselves as a whole and react in real-time, then they begin to function as a whole instead of just a collection of separate parts. As this shift transpires the state of the whole begins to feedback into the behavior of the parts, and the state of the parts in turns feeds back to the state of the whole. This cycle of bidirectional feedback between the parts and whole is the essence of cognition in all intelligent systems, whether individual brains, artificial intelligences, or entire worlds.<br /> </p>

<p>I believe that the time has come for this collective self to emerge on our planet. Like a vast virtual mirror, it will function as the planetary analogue to our own individual self-representations -- that capacity of our individual minds which represents us back to ourselves. It will be comprised of maps that combine real-time periodic data updates, and historical data, from perhaps trillions of data sources (one for each person, group, organization and software agent on the grid). The resulting visualizations will be something like a vast fluid flow, or a many particle simulation. It will require a massive computing capability to render it -- perhaps a distributed supercomputer comprised of the nodes on the Web themselves, each hosting a part of the process. It will require new thinking about how to visualize trends in such vast amounts of data and dimensions. This is a great unexplored frontier in data visualization and knowledge discovery.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.4em;"><strong><u><br />How It Might Work</u></strong></span> </p>

<p>I envision the planetary self functioning as a sort of portal -- a Web service that aggregates and distributes all kinds of current real-time and historical data about the state of the whole, as well as its past states and future projected states. This portal would collect opinions, trends, and statistics about the human global mind, the environment, the economy, society, geopolitical events, and other indicators, and would map them graphically in time, geography, demography, and subject space -- enabling everyone to see and explore the state of the global mind from different perspectives, with various overlays, and at arbitrary levels of magnification. </p>

<p>I think this system should provide an open data
model, and open API for adding and growing data sets, querying, remixing,
visualizing, and subscribing to the data.
All services that provide data sets, analysis or
visualizations (or other interpretations) of potential value to
understanding the state of the whole would be able to post data into
our service for anyone to find and use. Search engines could post in
the top search query terms. Sites that create tag clouds could post in
tags and tag statistics. Sites that analyze the blogosphere could post
in statistics about blogs, bloggers, and blog posts. Organizations that
do public opinion polling, market and industry research, trend
analysis, social research, or economic research could post in
statistics they are generating. Academic researchers could post in
statistics generated by projects they are doing to analyze trends on
the Web, or within our data-set itself. </p>

<p>As data is pushed to us, or
pulled by us, we would grow the largest central data repository about
the state of the whole. Others could then write programs to analyze and
remix our data, and then post their results back into the system for
others to use as well. We would make use of our data for our own
analysis, but anyone else could also do research and share their
analysis through our system. End users and others could also subscribe
to particular data, reports, or visualizations from our service, and
could post in their own individual opinions, attention data feeds, or
other inputs. We would serve as a central hub for search, analysis,
and distribution of collective self-awareness. </p>

<p>The collective self would provide a sense of collective identity: who are we, how do we appear, what are we thinking about, what do we think about what we are thinking about, what are we doing, how well are we doing it, where are we now, where have we been, where are we going next. Perhaps it could be segmented by nation, or by age group, or by other dimensions as well to view various perspectives on these questions within it. It could gather its data by mining for it, as well as through direct push contributions from various data-sources. Individuals could even report on their own opinions, state, and activities to it if they wanted to, and these votes and data points would be reflected back in the whole in real time. Think of it as a giant emergent conversation comprised of trillions of participants, all helping to make sense of the same subject -- our global self identity -- together. It could even have real-time views that are animated and alive -- like a functional brain image scan -- so that people could see the virtual neurons and pathways in the global brain firing as they watch.</p>

<p>If this global self-representation existed, I would want to subscribe to it as a data feed on my desktop. I would want to run it in a dashboard in the upper right corner of my monitor -- that I could expand at any time to explore further. It would provide me with alerts when events transpired that matched my particular interests, causes, or relationships. It would solicit my opinions and votes on issues of importance and interest to me. It would simultaneously function as my window to the world, and the world's window to me. It would be my way of participating in the meta-level whole, whenever I wanted to. I could tell it my opinions about key issues, current events, problems, people, organizations, or even legislative proposals. I could tell it about the quality of life from my perspective, where I am living, in my industry and demographic niche. I could tell it about my hopes and fears for the future. I could tell it what I think is cool, or not cool, interesting or not interesting, good or bad, etc. I could tell it what news I was reading and what I think is noteworthy or important. And it would listen and learn, and take my contributions into account democratically along with those of billions of other people just like me all around the world. From this would emerge global visualizations and reports about what we are all thinking and doing, in aggregate, that I could track and respond to. Linked from these flows I could then find relevant news, conversations, organizations, people, products, services, events, and knowledge. And from all of this would emerge something greater than anything I can yet imagine -- a thought process too big for any one human mind to contain.<br /> </p>





<p>I want to build this. I want to build the planetary Self. I am not suggesting that we build the entire global mind, I am just suggesting that we build the part of the system that functions as its collective self-awareness. The rest of the global mind is already there, as raw potential at least, and doesn't have to be built. The Web, human minds, software agents, and organizations already exist. Their collective state just needs to be reflected in a single virtual mirror. As soon as this mirror exists they can begin to collectively self-organize and behave more intelligently, simply because they will have, for the first time, a way of measuring their collective state and behavior. Once there is a central collective self-awareness loop, the intelligence of the global mind will emerge and self-organize naturally over time. This collective self-awareness infrastructure is the central enabling technology that has to be there first for the next-leap in intelligence of the global mind to evolve.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.4em;"><strong><u>Project Structure</u></strong></span></p>

<p>I think this should be created as a non-profit open-source project. In fact, that is the only way that it can have legitimacy -- it must be independent of any government, cultural or commercial perspective. It must be by and for the people, as purely and cleanly as possible. My guess is that to build this properly we would need to create a distributed grid computing system to collect, compute, visualize and distribute the data -- it could be similar to SETI@Home; everyone could help host it. At the center of this grid, or perhaps in a set of supernodes, would be a vast supercomputing array that would manage the grid, do focused computations and data fusion operations. There would also need to be some serious money behind this project as well -- perhaps from major foundations and donors. This system would be a global resource of potential incalculable value to the future of human evolution. It would be a project worth funding.</p>

        <summary>A radical new form of propulsion is being researched that may enable travel from Earth to Mars in 3 hours, and travel to nearby stars in just 80 days. The system is based on a novel quantum theory termed Heim quantum theory (HQT).The hypothetical device, which has been outlined in principle but is based on a controversial theory about the fabric of the universe, could potentially allow a spacecraft to travel to Mars in three hours and journey to a star 11 light years away in just 80 days, according to a report in today&apos;s New Scientist magazine. The theoretical engine works by creating an intense magnetic field that, according to ideas first developed by the late scientist Burkhard Heim in the 1950s, would produce a gravitational field and result in thrust for a spacecraft. Also, if a large enough magnetic field was created, the craft would slip into a different dimension, where the speed of light is faster, allowing incredible speeds to be reached. Switching off the magnetic field would result in the engine reappearing in our current dimension. The US air force has expressed an interest in the idea and scientists working for the American Department of Energy - which has a device known as the Z Machine that could generate the kind of magnetic fields required to drive the engine - say they may carry out a test if the theory withstands further scrutiny. Professor Jochem Hauser, one of the scientists who put forward the idea, told The Scotsman that if everything went well a working engine could be tested in about five years. However, Prof Hauser, a physicist at the Applied Sciences University in Salzgitter, Germany, and a former chief of aerodynamics at the European Space Agency, cautioned it was based on a highly controversial theory...</summary>

based on a controversial theory about the fabric of the universe, could
potentially allow a spacecraft to travel to Mars in three hours and
journey to a star 11 light years away in just 80 days, according to a
report in today's New Scientist magazine. </p>

<p>The
theoretical engine works by creating an intense magnetic field that,
according to ideas first developed by the late scientist Burkhard Heim
in the 1950s, would produce a gravitational field and result in thrust
for a spacecraft. </p>

<p>Also, if a large enough magnetic field was created, the craft would
slip into a different dimension, where the speed of light is faster,
allowing incredible speeds to be reached. Switching off the magnetic
field would result in the engine reappearing in our current dimension. </p>

<p>The US air force has expressed an interest in the idea and
scientists working for the American Department of Energy - which has a
device known as the Z Machine that could generate the kind of magnetic
fields required to drive the engine - say they may carry out a test if
the theory withstands further scrutiny.</p>

<p>Professor Jochem Hauser, one of the scientists who put forward the
idea, told The Scotsman that if everything went well a working engine
could be tested in about five years. </p>
<p>However, Prof Hauser, a physicist at the Applied Sciences University
in Salzgitter, Germany, and a former chief of aerodynamics at the
European Space Agency, cautioned it was based on a highly controversial
theory that would require a significant change in the current
understanding of the laws of physics. <a href=" http://news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=16902006">(Source)</a> </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It is interesting to note that this
theory shares a similar physical picture, namely a quantized spacetime,
with the recently published loop quantum theory (LQT) by L. Smolin, A.
Ashtektar, C. Rovelli, M. Bojowald et al. [11, 24-28]. LQT, if proved
correct, would stand for a major revision of current physics, while HQT
would cause a revolution in the technology of propulsion. <a href="http://public.fh-wolfenbuettel.de/~haeuser/research/futureProp.html">(Source)</a> </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Guidelines+for+a+space+propulsion+device+based+on+Heim%27s+quantum+theory&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">Links for further reading on this subject.</a><br /><br /> </p>

        <summary>OK well, I tried to avoid it, but tonight I went to see the movie, King Kong. And I&apos;m glad I did. It was, in a word, incredible. First of all it&apos;s got the most amazing special effects I&apos;ve ever seen (and you&apos;ll agree, trust me). Kong is totally realistic, and totally believable. But that&apos;s just the beginning. This flick has it all -- adventures at sea, massive jungle island ruins, stampeding dinosaurs, disgusting giant bugs, monster bats, bi-planes, lots of people running around with tommy-guns, and incredibly realistic renditions of New York in the 1930&apos;s. Oh yeah, and there is a pretty good emotional connection between the lead actress and Kong too -- quite believable and touching. It was loads of fun, visually, and also just an all-round excellent production. You will enjoy...</summary>
