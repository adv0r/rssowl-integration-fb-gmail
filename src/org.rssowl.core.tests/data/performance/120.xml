    <link>http://medpundit.blogspot.com/2006/05/so-long-farewell-auf-weidersehen-adieu.html</link>
    <description>&lt;b&gt;So Long, Farewell, Auf Weidersehen, Adieu:&lt;/b&gt; Last week, during an interview about medical blogging, I found myself speaking about Medpundit in the past tense. It surprised me a little, but not completely. Whether or not to go on with this blog is something that I've been mulling over for several weeks. I didn't want to admit it, but hearing myself refer to the blog as "was" and "has been" made me realize that deep down I had made my decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long time readers will have noticed that the frequency and quality of posts have been declining over the past several months. That is because I no longer have the time needed to devote to it. The phrase "declining reimbursement and rising overhead," is repeated so often in medicine that it seems a cliche, but it's also a reality. I'm spending longer hours at work and seeing more patients  to support my office and my family. The 1-2 hours a day it takes to keep up the blog are no longer there. I don't have any hope of that getting better in the foreseeable future. In fact, I anticipate that in the next 1-2 years, I'll be adding even more office hours until I've reached the limits of my physical and mental capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've also come to realize that I've been neglecting my family too long. When I went to a conference last month, I took my  children with me.  The time I had alone with them reminded me how much  I enjoy their company. And it reminded me of how much I've been missing. In another three years, my oldest will leave home and start his own life. The other three will follow in quick succession. I want to enjoy the time I have with them with as little distraction as possible. Work is a necessary distraction. Blogging isn't. My youngest son really drove the lesson home for me on Mother's Day, when he gave me his gift - a flower accompanied by a paragraph  written in school. It said, "My mom's a doctor. She owns her own office. She spends all day seeing patients. When she comes home, she does paperwork. But she still has time for me when I scrape my knees."&lt;br /&gt;I'd like to have time for him when he hasn't scraped his knees, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so, it's with regret that I take the necessary step of closing down this blog. It's been fun, and I'll miss it, but there are other things in life that need - and deserve - my attention more.  &lt;a href="http://www.lyricsdownload.com/sound-of-music-so-long-farewell-lyrics.html"&gt;So long, farewell&lt;/a&gt;, readers. The pleasure has been entirely mine.</description>

    <description>&lt;b&gt;Politicizing Science:&lt;/b&gt; If the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services were to go to a pharmaceutical company and advise them on how to get their drug approved in the United States in order to satisfy the objectives of an influential campaign donor to the sitting President, wouldn't that be a politicization of the drug approval process to a profound and crass degree? Why, yes, it would. But, apparently, it has &lt;a href="http://judicialwatch.org/archive/2006/jw-ru486-report.pdf"&gt;happened&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;[A big drug company] had historically refused to permit [a subdivision of the big drug company] to seek marketing approval for [a desired drug]... in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both [FDA] and I (HHS) have taken steps to persuade [the subdivision] and [the big drug company] to change their positions. In February, [we] met with ... the President of [the subdivision], to discuss the availability of [the desired drug] in the United States for research and marketing. In March I wrote to....[the] President of the Board of [the big drug company], to ask him to permit [the subdivision] to begin any necessary testing of [the desired drug] in the United States in Preparion for filing a new drug application with the FDA.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....FDA arranged a meeting between [the subdivision] and [a U.S. non-profit research group]. The meeting's purpose was to facilitate an agreement between those parties to work together to test [the drug] and file a new drug application for the drug. The [research group] was identified as the most likely group to work with [the subdivision] because of an existing contract between these two parties that required [the subdivision] to give [the research group] sufficient amounts of the drug for the [research group] to conduct clinical trials. The contract also appeared to require [the subdivision] to license the drug to [the research group] if [ the drug company] was unwilling to sell the drug in the United States.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like the FDA and the HHS are more interested in getting said drug to market than  making sure it's safe. That seems an extraordinary role for both agencies, does it not? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year was 1993.  The drug, RU-486. Today, it was revealed that a &lt;a href="http://www.lifenews.com/nat2267.html"&gt;seventh&lt;/a&gt; woman died after using the much desired drug.</description>

    <description>&lt;b&gt;Healthier Than Thou:&lt;/b&gt; A study in today's &lt;i&gt;JAMA&lt;/i&gt; says that the British are &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/05/02/sick.america.ap/index.html"&gt;healthier than Americans&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; Middle-aged, white Americans are much sicker than their counterparts in England, startling new research shows, despite U.S. health care spending per person that's more than double what England spends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A higher rate of Americans tested positive for diabetes and heart disease than the English. Americans also self-reported more diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, lung disease and cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gap between the countries holds true for educated and uneducated, rich and poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"At every point in the social hierarchy there is more illness in the United States than in England and the differences are really dramatic," said study co-author Dr. Michael Marmot, an epidemiologist at University College London in England.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The study limited itself to non-Hispanic white Americans and non-Asian white Englishmen.  The disparity does not seem to be due to access to care:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But richer Americans' health status resembled the health of the low-income British.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in fact, in their paper, the authors say that access to insurance seemed to have little impact on the differences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is a difference between the two populations that is being overlooked - white people are not ethnically homogenous.  Most white people in England might share the same ethnicity, but white people in America can not be assumed to share it. Not with Englishman, and not with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White people in America are not all Anglo-Saxons. Even those named Smith or Kerry have a varied genetic background. We really are a melting pot of races. There are a lot of families in this country who may look white, but who carry a hodge-podge of different ethnic populations in their genes.</description>

Resistance may not be futile, as people across the political spectrum have a vested interest in protecting themselves from governing boards that would decide they aren't worth saving:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The conservative pro-lifers moved this story, through the network and quick responses put in place by the death of Terri Schiavo. But the appeal for Andrea Clark originally appeared on a left-wing website, Democratic Underground, where the response was strong and heartfelt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, many activists against euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide—Wesley Smith among them—pitched their appeal primarily to the Left. Smith was a Naderite, co-authoring books with Ralph Nader, and he, like many others, originally thought of the fight in leftist terms: the struggle of citizens against large-corporation hospitals, insurance companies, and HMOs. But they got very little traction on the Left, and gradually found themselves preaching to the pro-life community on the Right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That the pro-life political connection isn’t necessary seems to be proved by the reaction to Andrea Clark’s story on Democratic Underground.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/smithw/smith200604271406.asp"&gt;Here's&lt;/a&gt; the story of Andrea Clark. And here's a quote worth remembering:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;As German physician Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland wrote presciently in 1806, "It is not up to [the doctor] whether . . . life is happy or unhappy, worthwhile or not, and should he incorporate these perspectives into his trade . . . the doctor could well become the most dangerous person in the state."&lt;/i&gt;</description>

    <link>http://medpundit.blogspot.com/2006/04/dr.html</link>
    <description>&lt;b&gt;Dr. New Jersey:&lt;/b&gt; The New Jersey legislature has passed a law requiring doctors to &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002955807_depress27.html"&gt;screen and educate their patients for post-partum depression&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The boldest move has come in New Jersey, where a first-of-its-kind law was signed this month requiring doctors to educate expectant mothers and their families about postpartum depression and to screen new moms for the condition.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of you depressed people are on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bioethics Blog wonders if the state plans to &lt;a href="http://blog.bioethics.net/2006/04/tom-cruise-does-not-live-in-new-jersey.html"&gt;pay for the therapy&lt;/a&gt;. Good question. It leads to the bigger question of how a law like this will translate into real life. Imagine yourself a busy obstetrician, already beleagured by high malpractice premiums and decreasing insurance reimbursements that make it necessary for you to see more patients. Now, not only do you have to be worried about being sued for malpractice if you miss a case of post-partum depression; you also have to worry about criminal charges. After all, now there's a law on the book making it illegal not to check everyone and inform everyone about depression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some doctors will just stop taking care of pregnant women. It will be the proverbial last straw for them. Others will just initiate a system for every pregnant woman that involves minimal doctor time. Something like an educational brochure given to every woman who walks in the door, and a check list of depressive symptoms. And what happens when there are some positive responses, such as "Have you been unhappy in the past six weeks?" They'll get placed on an anti-depressant. You bet. It's a boondoggle of a law for the makers of anti-depressants. But it probably will do little to improve healthcare.</description>
