<tagline mode="escaped" type="text/html">Marketing? Me? I spend a good deal of time railing against marketing and consumerism, but I am by profession a marketing ...erm... professional. People are individuals, not 'targets'; they are producers, not consumers; and 'we' (being marketers) are 'they' and 'we' should never forget that.

I call my technique Pinko Marketing - Commons-Based Unmarketing.</tagline>

<br/>
<br/>After being out of touch for 10+ days, I'm having a tough time getting fully re-oriented. Much can happen in 10 days when traveling. I'm going to summarize stuff briefly below:<br/>
<ol>
<li>That gorgeous kid above is my <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/">PiC</a> as a child. Adorable, eh? I had the pleasure of meeting much of his family this past weekend in our travels to New Hampshire. It was so nice just to have Chris show me around his roots. And eye-opening. He was raised wealthy. With a pool. In a beautiful New England home. But he's this amazing down-to-earth guy with a passion to help others. He totally had the priviledge and could have used it to secure a fancy pants job in Boston (which is a very pretty city btw) where he would have made a gazillion dollars and had his own big house with a pool in a fancy pants neighbourhood. Instead, he lives in a regular apartment in San Francisco. Without a car (by choice). With a desire to keep detached from worldly possessions and to attach himself, instead to relationships and causes. I don't know. I think that is pretty great. It made me love him all that much more.<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.meshconference.com">Mesh</a> was awesome. My keynote went well, even though I <a href="http://www.propr.ca/index.php/2006/mesh-day-two-tara-hunt/">had</a> <a href="http://www.dandickinson.com/wordpress/?p=1782">my</a> <a href="http://accordionguy.blogware.com/blog">usual</a> <a href="http://www.thomaspurves.com/?p=32">critics</a>. (and a great <a href="http://peterdawson.typepad.com/blog/2006/05/tara_voice_of_t.html">thumbs up</a> or <a href="http://christen.dybenko.net/index.cfm/2006/5/21/PINKO">two</a>) Ah, I figure I would be doing something wrong if everybody agreed with me. I also made some amazing contacts and padded the Pinko list significantly from the experience. My favourite moment was the guy who came up to me afterwards and said, "Okay, so I work for one of those evil 'viral' agencies you talked about. I have no idea what to do with this information, but I know I have to do something." Change is painful. The road ahead is not simple.<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampTdot">BarcampTdot</a> rocked. Okay, so we were late, but it still rocked. <a href="http://www.davidcrow.ca">David</a> and <a href="http://www.radiantcore.com">Jay</a>...thanks for putting such a great event together. The lot of us geeked out well after we left the event space.<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>Met many amazing people in Toronto. List: <a href="http://married-inc.com/">John and Malgosia</a>, <a href="http://www.davidcrow.ca">David</a> and <a href="http://www.heeney.ca">Kristen</a>, <a href="http://www.radiantcore.com">Jay</a> and <a href="http://malaprop.typepad.com/">Bianca</a> (knew already, but must list), <a href="http://www.gagglescape.com/">Robert Oullette</a> (who wrote a <a href="http://www.gagglescape.com/index.php/site/comments/267/">great article</a> post-amazing conversation), <a href="http://ounpuu.blogspot.com/">John Ounpuu</a>, <a href="http://www.micropersuasion.com">Steve Rubel</a>, <a href="http://accordionguy.blogware.com/">Joey </a>and <a href="http://redhead.blogware.com/">Wendy</a> (knew, too, but must list), <a href="http://www.endlesseurope.com">Matt Dickenson</a> (from a really really cool project, Endless Europe), <a href="http://peterdawson.typepad.com/blog">Peter Dawson</a>, <a href="http://www.rohanjayasekera.com/blog/">Rohan Jayasekera</a>, <a href="http://www.bryght.com/blog/boris-mann">Boris Mann</a> (this guy is a hoot), <a href="http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/wiki/today.php">Miss Sacha</a> (the fabulous one)...and many more...<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>Somehow I ended up quoted in the <a href="http://money.canoe.ca/News/Other/2006/05/20/1589933-cp.html">Calgary Sun</a>. LOL. Am I the new definitive Canadian corporate blogger? Isn't this how Brian Adams felt? ;)<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>We hung out at the very cool <a href="http://www.linuxcaffe.ca/">Linux Caffe</a>. Met David, the owner. If I lived in Toronto again, this would be my second home.<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>I have soooo <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/missrogue/">many photos</a>...I'm in the midst of organizing them (thank goodness for the newest release of Flickr, eh?) and will have albums soon.</li>
</ol>Okay...so back to work. Many ideas. Chris and I, having been slightly offline for 4 days, had all sorts of revelations (and had the opportunity to reconnect, which was excellent...we forget how busy and stressed we get - we've decided to reconnect regularly offline. Weekend getaway suggestions welcomed).<br/>
<br/>...sigh...</div>

<title mode="escaped" type="text/html">Which brings me to Winecamp...this weekend</title>
<content type="application/xhtml+xml" xml:base="http://www.horsepigcow.com/index.html" xml:space="preserve">
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yep. We just got back late last night and it's straight into <a href="http://www.winecampcalaveras.com">Winecamp</a>...<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.mollyguard.com/event/27961634">

</a>
<br/>
<br/>I can't believe that it's already this weekend (May 26-28). If you haven't read about it before, Winecamp is:<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"/>...an ad-hoc un-conference, set in wine country. It is born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. Its goal is to bring together the innovators of the tech worlds with the innovators of the npo world to discuss solutions that help build community, motivate members, and ease collaboration based on existing, easily-accessible and open-source tools.<br/>
<br/>And, unlike <a href="http://barcamp.org">Barcamps</a> before, it does <a href="http://www.mollyguard.com/event/27961634">require registration</a> (with a small $60 cost for food). Why?<br/>
<ol>
<li>Because Chris and I have to go to Costco and buy food and haul it up 3 hours in a rental vehicle to Calaveras county and plan meals and make certain everyone is covered.<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>Because we have to ensure there is a good balance of geeks and do-gooders to get those projects moving (we are, thusfar, perfectly balanced)<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>Because we need to make certain we have space for everyone to pitch their tents on the picturesque, but rudimentary hilltop of the vineyard, making certain we have plenty of firepits, water, etc. for everyone to have the survivor weekend we are looking for. ;)</li>
</ol>So, if you are planning to come, <a href="http://www.mollyguard.com/event/27961634">please register</a> so we can feed you et al. Oh...and if you have any questions, drop <a href="mailto:barcamp@gmail.com">us a line</a>, check out the <a href="http://barcamp.org/WineCamp">wiki</a>, check out the <a href="http://barcamp.org/WineFAQ">FAQs</a>, check out the <a href="http://barcamp.org/WineCampRideShare">rideshare</a> page and check out the <a href="http://barcamp.org/WineCampIneedIgot">I Need I Got</a> page!<br/>
<br/>I think, despite my aversion for camping (as well as Tad's), this is going to be an awesome weekend. ;)<br/>
<br/>Oh and, check out the sponsors: <a href="http://www.francetelecom.com/en/">France Telecom</a>, <a href="http://www.edgeio.com">Edgeio</a>, <a href="http://www.riya.com">Riya</a>, <a href="http://www.flock.com">Flock</a>, <a href="http://www.rfwine.com/">Ferriere Vineyards</a>, <a href="http://www.stormhoek.com/">Stormhoek</a>, <a href="http://www.netsquared.org">Net Squared</a> (rumor has it that <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">Michael Arrington</a> is donning an apron and flipping pancakes on Saturday morning...I wouldn't miss it. ;))<br/>

<br/>[I'm on a panel here + <span style="font-style: italic;">im</span>moderating a session]<br/>
<br/>On May 30-31st in San Jose, CA the NetSquared Conference will convene early adopters, technologists, corporations, philanthropists, and nonprofit and non-governmental leaders to discuss and take concrete steps towards using social web tools like blogging, vlogging, tagging and podcasting for social change.<br/>
<br/>You can participate in the conference remotely in 3 ways:<br/>
<br/>1. Participate in the <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/remote#chat">NetSquared chatroom</a> where speakers like Mike Linksvayer of Creative Commons, Scott Heiferman of Meetup.com and Robyn Deupree of Bloglines will be sharing info. and answering questions.<br/>
<br/>2. Chat it up in the <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/hallway">Conference Hallway chat room</a>. We're using Gabbly.com for both chats which is super easy and user-friendly.<br/>
<br/>3. Post a question to be asked at a conference session, or write a blog post to start the conversation online.  Just peruse the conference sessions (link below) and click on a theme and session topic that interests you.  At <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/conference/conference-sessions">the bottom of the session description</a> you can add your question or blog post. <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/conference/conference-sessions"/>
<br/>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">...just a little note from my treo at the fabulous Reservoir Lounge in Tdot (forgot how much I love this place).<br/>
<br/>Last minute after a great <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Toronto_Salon">Creative Commons Salon</a> and a fabulous dinner with <a href="http://www.radiantcore.com">Jay</a>, <a href="http://www.aweebitskint.com/">Bianca</a>, <a href="http://www.davidcrow.ca">David</a> and <a href="http://heeney.ca/">Kristen</a> at <a href="http://www.frommers.com/destinations/toronto/D49117.html">La Palette</a> (another gem on Tdot)...I became overwhelmed with the desire to drag Chris to the <a href="http://www.reservoirlounge.com/">Reservoir Lounge</a> for some swinging jazz Tyler Yarema tuesday...and if that didn't already make this the perfect end to a brilliant day (<a href="http://www.meshconference.com">Mesh</a> rocked and my preso went better than I could jave imagined)...well, if that wasn't enough...<br/>

<br/>Plus, that's changing, too. Money isn't the only currency in town. Yes, you need money to keep a company going, pay your employees, pay yourself, build better stuff for your community...but is there a specific amount you are going for or is bigger just better? I beg to differ.<br/>
<br/>I don't think that more of anything after a certain point (comfort/survival/free of worry/freedom/etc.) makes you exponentially more happy. In fact, I think it could make you:<br/>
<ol>
<li>overwhelmed...then...<br/>
</li>
<li>stressed out...which makes one...</li>
<li>unhappy...'cause all of a sudden you are...<br/>
</li>
<li>subject to scrutiny, criticism and jealousy...which leads to one becoming...<br/>
</li>
<li>paraniod</li>
</ol>Which I can imagine sucks big time.<br/>
<br/>When you get into that top spot, it's just a matter of clinging onto it until the next popularity contest winner comes along (or so goes my theory as I've never been the most popular, which may account for this string of thought. ;)).<br/>
<br/>So, I created this little diagram to illustrate my Fringe theory:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/missrogue/144710389/" title="Photo Sharing">
<img alt="#1? No way, gimme the Fringe anyday" height="324" src="http://static.flickr.com/45/144710389_7dad5a28b9_o.png" width="500"/>
</a>
<br/>
<br/>Nice, huh? Yeah, well, my (rather unpopular at times) philosophy is that we all should be so blessed (and good, I may add) as to be Stewart and Caterina (who are in the bright blue 'pretty darned awesome' box above). 3 million is an amazing number of happy and fulfilled people to mingle with. Personally, I would be giving Yahoo some major push-back on wanting to grow me to the Yahoo!Photos size.<br/>
<br/>Yeah...small is the new big. And Fringe is the new...um...success story. Yeah. Fringe is the new success story.<br/>

I really liked the movie. I thought it was pretty brilliant. But I have never been able to 'get' what it is that gets almost every man I've ever met so whipped up into a cult-like frenzy. Maybe you know a woman or two who gets it, but most of the women I know either mildly or kind of liked the movie, but don't see what all of the hubub is about. But I think that's the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we discussed this at length. What is it about Fight Club that touches stuff so deeply within the male psyche?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be the movie's total rejection of the feminization of our culture (as Tantek pointed out). A reclamation of non-tainted masculinity. It could be the inner warrior cry it invokes. Who knows? But what we decided we need to do is to get a group of men and women together and show Fight Club and Thelma &amp; Louise (the female cult film - the ultimate 'eff you' to the patriarchy ;)) back to back so we can compare notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, what I'm interested in is the way this movie is bound to capture the hearts of men for generations to come. It was actually a 'bit of a disappointment' at the box office (from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The film was a box office disappointment (although it was #1 at the U.S. box office in its first weekend) and critical reaction was mixed, but a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film" title="Cult film"&gt;cult following&lt;/a&gt; soon emerged as the DVD of the film was popular upon release (with some critics changing their opinions on it as a result of the DVD).&lt;/blockquote&gt;This movie, that spoke directly to the most coveted marketing target of our society - the white, heterosexual, 18-34 year old, educated male - and will be loved for generations to come, but no blockbuster. On the fringe. Holding strong. Having longevity and character and connecting with a group of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of reminds me of a section of the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591840783/104-0673512-6737542?v=glance&amp;n=283155"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Brand Hijack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Alex Wipperfürth) where he talks about using cult-building strategies. Now, although &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Brand Hijack&lt;/span&gt;'s premise and initial connection between cults and community was astute, he didn't quite understand that this can never be a 'strategy' - one iota of inauthenticity here wouldn't have achieved this. However, I do think it shows that Chuck Palahnuik (author of Fight Club) weaved a story from a very real angst he felt that connected deeply with others. Fight clubs happen all over the world still and I am still subjected to sitting through conversations about how &lt;a href="http://barcamp.org"&gt;BarCamp&lt;/a&gt; can re-purpose the rules of Fight Club. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some cult-like linkage:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.project-mayhem.ndo.co.uk/"&gt;Project Mayhem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://cbs5.com/watercooler/local_story_059005903.html"&gt;Footage of Silicon Valley's Engineer Fight Clubs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://metaphilm.com/philm.php?id=29_0_2_0"&gt;Fight Club comparison with Calvin and Hobbes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hundland.com/scripts/Fight-Club_third.htm"&gt;Movie Script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh...and I was a litle startled by this: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club_%28musical%29"&gt;Fight Club, the Musical&lt;/a&gt;!

<title mode="escaped" type="text/html">UPS Misses the Pinko Boat</title>
<content type="application/xhtml+xml" xml:base="http://www.horsepigcow.com/index.html" xml:space="preserve">
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I was expecting an important package to arrive yesterday or today from a shipper via UPS.  I paid 2x the shipping price to have this happen.<br/>
<br/>The shipper made a mistake and put that our offices are at #209 instead of #210 (a difference of one door), so they sent my package back.<br/>
<br/>My phone number was printed on that package. The UPS delivery person was most likely standing outside of our office at some point. There was no phonecall.<br/>
<br/>Now, because I need that package TODAY, I have to borrow a vehicle to drive to another town to get that package.<br/>
<br/>I asked the customer service agent:<br/>
<br/>"Is my phone number on the package?"<br/>
<br/>"Yes ma'am, but the drivers don't have cell phones."<br/>
<br/>"Why not?"<br/>
<br/>"It's a huge expense and a big decision to do something like this company wide."<br/>
<br/>"But it would have saved me a hassle. In fact, I've dealt with this several times now. [this is not the first time UPS and/or FedEx has done this] Why not shift that big advertising budget just a wee bit to invest in some cell phones for your drivers?"<br/>
<br/>Silence...then excuses. I know that it isn't the customer service agent's fault. He just isn't empowered to help me. He probably isn't paid enough to care. They have what I need, so I have to suck it up. It certainly doesn't make me feel very good about UPS. In fact, everytime I am expecting a delivery, I now expect that 50% of the time it won't make it to me. That's sad. This means that a new company can come along who raises expectations just a little bit and I'd switch. It would be THAT easy.<br/>
<br/>Spend the money on the cell phones. If the address is wrong, try calling the recipient. Most people are sitting and waiting for the package.<br/>
<br/>My last message to the customer service agent, "Sir, please leave a note on this delivery record that I will be blogging this."<br/>
<br/>:: Update...I just received a call back from David (the customer service agent). He may be able to help me after all...let's see...Maybe the blogging thing got him piqued. ;)<br/>
<br/>:: Update #2...yay! The driver came back and showed me that it was the UPS clerk error (the shipper had put the proper addy on the package, then the clerk at the Menlo Park UPS changed it). But he came back. Still needs a cell phone...but I'm impressed.<br/>

</div>				<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	You know me. I'm all for social systems and public programs that provide for the community.<br/>
<br/>But I'm also well aware that, in their current state, they don't work worth a crap.<br/>
<br/>If public transit was run as a business, the bus drivers could not get away with the way they treat their customers. If public transit was run as a business, there wouldn't be so much red tape to go through to put an extra train or two on a line that obviously needs it.<br/>
<br/>Standing in the station, waiting for the N line last night so I could get to my <a href="http://www.winecampcalaveras.com">WineCamp</a> meeting, I had to let 2 trains go by. They were so packed the doors wouldn't open. People looked ill. Meanwhile, about 5 J trains came by, 4 L trains and 2 M trains...all pretty empty. The third N came along packed full, but I crammed myself uncomfortably in, squishing the hell out of some poor older woman, who looked as if she was going to pass out three stops later.<br/>
<br/>There were still people left at many of the stations who couldn't get on. When I asked the muni operator, she said, "Yeah, we know, but the decision to add more trains to a route goes through a process." How long was that process? "Could be 6 months. Could be years."<br/>
<br/>Obviously the person who designed this 'process' never rode public transit. <br/>
<br/>Man...if local politicians were forced to ride public transit for only one week, I bet things ...um... may change.<br/>
<br/>But here is where the argument for privitization comes into play. Privitization allows for competition. If all of us crammed onto that train had a viable alternative that treated us better, would we take it? Damn right, we would. Of course, there are drawbacks to privatizing public programs. Profit mongering, for one, but dammit, the muni needs a kick in the butt.<br/>
<br/>And why don't people speak up? Well, I'm pretty sure that many do. But I think it falls on deaf ears. Nobody wants to take responsibility for it. It's public transit, right? Don't like it? Get a car, you bum. <br/>
<br/>There is nothing social about social systems.</p>

<br/>Kathy talked about this concept a while ago with her brilliant, <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/01/death_by_riskav.html">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Death by Risk Aversion</span>
</a> post. The image just rocks...<br/>
<br/>Yes...crap happens when fear occurs...but crap also happens when success occurs.<br/>
<br/>Ever notice that stuff (music, products, blogs, ideas) that is really awesome gets less awesome when it hits the mainstream? Much related to my, "I always want to be on the fringe" <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2006/05/conventional-wisdom-has-never-been.html">post</a> (which is both a conscious and non-conscious effort), I see so many bands and bloggers and other more public-type figures compromising their own genius to please a wider audience.<br/>
<br/>That's too bad.<br/>
<br/>I can think of loads of examples of musicians who never really 'sold out' into this idea who made oodles of money, continue to have loyal fans and will continue to be celebrated for eons, mostly because they stuck true to their natural voice.<br/>
<br/>Radiohead...Leonard Cohen...Pink Floyd...Nina Simone...Elvis Costello...Parliament...Jane Siberry...etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>What happens is that one gets a bit popular and realizes that it is certain songs, posts, features, whatever, that seems to get noticed. When this is recognized, it's perfectly natural to think, "Man, people dig this, so I should keep producing this." Popularity soars. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_Poppy_Syndrome">Tall poppy syndrome</a> occurs (thanks <a href="http://blog.bibrik.com/">Rachel</a>). The next big thing comes along. Popularity fades.<br/>
<br/>I don't know...being on the edges, being authentic, being true to oneself, being satisfied with strong relationships within your own niche...that's art. That's beauty. Well, at least it is to me.<br/>

You know...the ones that say, "MBA preferred" and "10+ years of experience" and "Proven this and that." Why not? Because I've always had the same feeling that &lt;a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/wisdomofcrowds/Q&amp;A.html"&gt;James Surowiecki&lt;/a&gt; has:&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Experts, no matter how smart, only have limited amounts of information. They also, like all of us, have biases. It's very rare that one person can know more than a large group of people, and almost never does that same person know more about a whole series of questions. The other problem in finding an expert is that it's actually hard to identify true experts. In fact, if a group is smart enough to find a real expert, it's more than smart enough not to need one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Problem #1 with being labeled an 'expert' is that PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU ARE THE FOREMOST AUTHORITY ON STUFF. Ha. Nobody is the foremost authority on stuff. Nobody. Nada. Not me. Not Seth. Not anyone. We know some stuff about some stuff and there will always be others that can: a. challenge us/shed some light and b. kick our ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;[I have been to several 'meetings' lately with people who want my advice on hiring people like me. I say, "Um....hire a non-marketing professional with zero experience and loads of  social skills. Someone who spends their time hanging with a community keeping it real. Then involve them in the deal-making process."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. Certainly maturity comes into play. Some people, being hired in this role will start to think, "Man, I'm in the marketing role now, so I have to do marketing stuff." Yikes. Please don't. In fact, give them a non-marketing title and encourage them otherwise.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that we should just say, "Screw marketing" let us replace it with other stuff. In fact, let's dispense with titles altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that's beside the point. Eff &lt;a href="http://www.squidoo.com"&gt;Squidoo&lt;/a&gt;. It's simple. It's fun. But it's no disruptive killer app that will change the world. No biggie. &lt;a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/blog/"&gt;Seth&lt;/a&gt; has said some sage stuff. He says that same sage stuff over an over again. People start to 'get it'. It's his legacy. Squidoo isn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know what is, though? &lt;a href="http://www.changethis.com"&gt;Change This&lt;/a&gt; (Seth's previous project). I love Change This. &lt;a href="http://amitgupta.com/blog/"&gt;Amit&lt;/a&gt;, who has dedicated much of his time to it, is brilliant. He's the dude. I met him at BarCampNewYork. He was one of the people on my 'have to meet' list. He has another amazing project, &lt;a href="http://www.photojojo.com/"&gt;Photojojo&lt;/a&gt;. He needn't pimp it, 'cause it just rocks. He involves himself in stuff he loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is...[like I ever get to one]...that we celebrate figureheads 'cause they are easy to celebrate, then we are disappointed when they don't deliver. Well, duh. They are human. Totally capable of doin' the dog. Nobody should be on a pedestal. Seriously. You invented the word AJAX? Good for you. You imagined a better, free, online encyclopedia? You rock, that's awesome. You said something profound about marketing? Nice. Wanna ride it forever and ever? Um. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are still human beings and the rest of the world is, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, really, not that I've ever been in that position, but I would imagine that being in a pedestal like focus would be some seriously major pressure to perform. I'd hate to walk around paranoid that my crown is going to be removed any second. Yikes. I'd rather be on the fringe trying to change stuff quietly(ish) and doing what I love anyday.</content>

<br/>Personally, I'm all for unpopular opinion.<br/>
<br/>I said the other night that I want to always be on the fringe...and I think I will...and it may sound very un-pinko to some, but I write for me, <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2006/04/i-dont-get-it.html#114649432902972993">not for anyone else or stats</a>. ;)<br/>
<br/>Personally, I think everyone should re-think how we 'rate' stuff. It isn't about popularity.</div>

</div>				<p class="flickr-yourcomment">	Further to the <a href="http://mashpit.pbwiki.com/TheLovendar">Lovendar</a>, I've been belly-aching about <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2006/04/maybe-they-should-stop-making-things.html">things being too easy for me</a>, I'm putting the call out there for someone (anyone?) to create a Bring Forward App for all of my 'toread/tolisten/towatch' and similarly put-off-for-a-rainy-day tags on <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> et al.<br/>
<br/>As a basic service, it could give me the option to temporarily store these items on my desktop, so that when offline and unable to distract myself with IM, email, RSS, et al, I can finally catch up on my reading (i.e. whilst riding the Caltrain). It would also give me gentle (but firm) reminders that these articles are getting pretty stale.<br/>
<br/>Even better, it would read the tags, keywords and general text of the article I've stored and, when I'm blogging or reading another article of interest that is related to something I've long since bookmarked and forgotten, it says, "Hey, dude, you have a seriously neglected article on this very subject you may want to compliment this experience with."<br/>
<br/>Man, that would be awesome.</p>
