            <description>          Ever have those bad dreams that involves being in school
(or on stage, or in public) and you look down to realize
you&#39;re  not wearing pants?   Here&#39;s the travelling geek&#39;s version of the
same: you wake up 5,600 miles from home and your suitcase 
has no usable pants.
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve been on the road 13 of the last 15 weeks, and I&#39;ve 
gotten my trip-to-trip turnaround down to just under 48
hours (I&#39;m not proud of that, but it&#39;s the truth).   Cycling
through business casual clothing, reading material, email downloads and
potential exercise wear is merely a matter of popping
the stack that comes from the dry cleaners, laundry room and
mailboxes.
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;ve learned to pack with reasonable redundancy, just in case
my clothing requirements are extended through missed flights, adverse
weather, or lap children in the row behind me that
prove &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment&quot;&gt;
Young&#39;s diffraction slit experiments&lt;/a&gt; apply to vomit and airline
seats (yes, that really happened, on the way to Australia).
One business trip with a wardrobe provided by
Toronto&#39;s Pearson Airport, featuring the entire
array of sweatpants and moose themed t-shirts, and you
pack extras where they are within easy reach even if 
your luggage is on its way to Iowa.
&lt;p&gt;
The root cause of the problem was taking this &quot;pop the
stack&quot; model too literally and without enough checking.
I grabbed two pairs of pants for this week&#39;s trip to
Israel, neatly folded them among the other biz wear,
and zipped up on my way to the Sun remote office 
in Newark&#39;s Liberty Airport (I&#39;m kidding, Mike Lehman).
&lt;p&gt;
14 hours later, while unpacking in Herzeliya, Israel,
I found that one pair of pants was ready for our
evening meeting with a high-ranking Israeli army officer,
and one pair belonged to my son.    I have never been
so neat at meal times and sensitive to dirt, grease and
possible clothing impairment as I was on this trip.   
&lt;p&gt;
Denial-of-pants service attacks avoided, I&#39;m back in NJ,
and gearing up for next week&#39;s trip. I hope I
don&#39;t live out the bad dream of finding out it&#39;s final
exam day and I didn&#39;t know I was registered for the
class.

            <description>          Most of my blog entries are about technology adoption and things that happen
on ice rinks.   When my social networks begin to comment on my technical
networks, I know we&#39;re making progress.   In the past two weeks, it&#39;s
happened twice, which is enough statistical signifcance for me to
blog about it (and perhaps stimulate more feedback).
&lt;p&gt;
The manager of one of my daughter&#39;s figure
skating teams emailed me from her new job, saying that she was now
a proud &lt;a href=&quot;http://openoffice.org&quot;&gt;OpenOffice&lt;/a&gt; user, and that
she loved it.
&lt;p&gt;
Last week, I got a similar email, completely unsolicited and unprompted,
from a Princeton classmate. He switched his small business to OpenOffice
from Microsoft Office to save &quot;thousands of dollars.&quot;   When it&#39;s your
own money, not the boss&#39; or the faceless &quot;company&#39;s money&quot;, this matters.

    <title>Sun Israel: 10 Years</title>

            <description>          I&#39;m returning from 48 hours in the land of milk and honey and venture capital and
cell phone users.   Sun celebrated 10 years of engineering in Israel with a
big tent event this week, and the spotlight was on us for the day.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;width: 180px; height: 120px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/roller/resources/stern/avenueil.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
vspace=&quot;10&quot; hspace=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
We were the first major event held at the Avenue, a new convention center
built on the edge of Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv.   The place was packed
from an hour before show time, with Sun partners, resellers, employees,
and customers.  Mostly customers -- there were over 1,200 people in attendance
at the Avenue for our 10 year celebration.  Obviously some were there to see
our host for the day,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shaister.com/index.php/?p=798&quot;&gt;Eyal Kitzis&lt;/a&gt;, the
hottest thing in Israeli comedy right now, but the vast majority of attendees
stayed through lunch and into the breakout sessions.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;width: 180px; height: 120px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/roller/resources/stern/il-100city.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
vspace=&quot;10&quot; hspace=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
This is what things looked like from the stage just before I did my
pitch, a shortened version of Sun&#39;s 100 City Road Show.  I cut the
deck down to size both because I was presenting in English (and not
getting nearly as many laughs as Kitzis) and because David Fishman,
one of our engineering directors splitting his time between Israel
and California wanted to ask me some questions.  In Hebrew.
&lt;p&gt;
It was time to fight fire with fire.  90% of the Hebrew words I&#39;ve
mastered involve food and beverages.   I can also ask people to
repeat themselves, loudly, which is &lt;i&gt;de rigeur&lt;/i&gt;
if cell phones are involved.   One of the first things I learned
was to order my fish without it staring at me, so in a quick
flash of code re-use I introduced &quot;Fish&quot; as &lt;i&gt;Dag Blee Rosh&lt;/i&gt;
(&quot;Fish Without A Head&quot;).   David fired back, asking me what I
said the last time I had a predominantly Jewish audience of
this size: &quot;I thanked the rabbi for helping me with my Bar
Mitzvah.&quot;   Good thing our technology story was better than our
comedy, because people stayed for that tag line.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;width: 180px; height: 120px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/roller/resources/stern/il-10year.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;
vspace=&quot;10&quot; hspace=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
And stay they did.   This is the scene from the partner area,
after lunch was served.  It was still hopping.  Press coverage hit
&lt;i&gt;Ha&#39;Aretz&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Globes&lt;/i&gt;, sort of the New York Post and
Financial Times equivalents in Israel. 
&lt;p&gt;
Big questions from the press included a discussion of open sourcing
Java SE, why we think the explosion of mobile devices is good for
Sun, and why we were excited by the Israeli economy. 
&lt;p&gt;
Big thanks to Michal Geva, David Fishman, Dan Toledano, Boaz Yehuda,
and the rest of the crew who made this event stunningly popular.
I can&#39;t wait for Sun&#39;s Israeli Bar Mitzvah in just three years.

            <description>          MaryMary may look and sound polite and All-American, but don&#39;t let her
&quot;Look at my business card collection, it&#39;s the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/mary?entry=the_loot&quot;&gt;
best
loot in the world&lt;/a&gt;&quot; line set the hook.

Here she is caught in the act, attempting to make off with a handsome
replica of some great work of art.  I guess that&#39;s where she
keeps the business cards when they&#39;re not on display in her blog.
&lt;p&gt;
Apologies to the Argent Hotel for both the number of &lt;a href=&quot;
http://www.rodargent.com/&quot;&gt;Rod Argent&lt;/a&gt; jokes I made this
week as well as disrupting your artwork.  Normally I&#39;m only
that badly behaved if there&#39;s a gingerbread house within
easy reach during the holiday season.

    <title>Open sourcing Java SE: Rights and mechanisms</title>
    <dc:creator>Hal Stern</dc:creator>
    <link>http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/stern?entry=open_sourcing_java_se_rights</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2006 09:05:41 -0700</pubDate>
    <category>Technology and Software</category>
            <description>          Jonathan Schwartz and Rich Green got JavaOne off to a non-traditional
start with a non-traditional answer to the question &quot;When are you going
to open source Java SE?&quot; Historically the answer has been a variation
of &quot;We&#39;re thinking about it&quot; which was the equivalent to the parental
response &quot;In a little while.&quot;  After, or &quot;after after&quot; in Mr. Miyagi terms.
&lt;p&gt;
Rich Green (my boss) gave a new answer: &quot;Not if but how.&quot;  Wrapped up
in that expression of &quot;how&quot; are a variety of rights representations and
mechanisms that the Java community (not just Sun) needs to sort out,
which is why Rich and Jonathan publicly asked for input on the &quot;how.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;
There are three sets of rights that need to be balanced, protected,
and in some cases, created: rights of compatibility (which is rule
one, and has been for a decade), rights of community members (in
all shapes and sizes) and rights of intellectual property flow (that is,
who does what with various original and derivative works).
&lt;p&gt;
Solving for compatibility is what will prevent &quot;fragmentation&quot; of
the market.  It assures that someone who runs a Java application
will get consistent results across compatible implementations.
Competition -- multiple implementations -- grows the market;
fragmentation -- different implementations -- is bad if
the competitive versions contain barriers to exit.  The market
for home electronics is both competitive and fragmented, but
there are compatibility modes (expressed as media types) that
prevent consumers from being hosed if they chose a particular
manufacturer.   Compatibility rights will involve branding,
validation, testing, logos and other indications that you&#39;re
dealing with a complete and consistent Java implementation.
&lt;p&gt;
The community members -- licensees, JCP members, developers, 
and end users -- also have a vested set of interests.   Access
to engineers, support, and services need to be laid out.  This
is an equally big part of the &quot;how&quot; process, intersecting the JCP,
governance processes and continued innovation in Java.
&lt;p&gt;
I believe that the final leg of the stool, the rights that govern
the flow of intellectual property, will likely be dependent on
the first two discussions.  Nominally, this is choosing a licensing
model for the open sourcing of Java SE, and that license has to
represent the rights of creators as well as consumers.   
&lt;p&gt;
Rich&#39;s expression of &quot;how&quot; was important enough that Jonathan
repeated it -- on stage, in the press Q&amp;A, and in 1:1 meetings.
Outlined above is what I&#39;ve been telling press and analysts in
my meetings, and the path along which &quot;how&quot; converts to &quot;now.&quot;

    <title>Measuring Derivatives: Revenue, Open Source, and Java</title>
    <dc:creator>Hal Stern</dc:creator>
    <link>http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/stern?entry=measuring_derivatives_revenue_open_source</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2006 23:36:07 -0700</pubDate>
    <category>Technology and Software</category>
            <description>          I&#39;ve survived day one of JavaOne well enough to stay up and write a bit.  This is
an accomplishment after several press and analyst 1:1s, a morning of keynotes, 
catching up with various co-workers, former co-workers and future co-workers,
and a succession of receptions, dinners and desserts (apologies to the international
press PR person who accidentally donated her creme brulee to me).
&lt;p&gt;
Best question of the day came from a writer who asked &quot;What will it take for Wall
Street to understand Sun&#39;s business model?&quot;  I agree with Jonathan that Sun may
very well end up looking like a media company, at least in terms of how we 
grow our business, monetize our assets, and measure potential for both of those
actions.  
&lt;p&gt;
There are three big changes in measurement underway: revenue as a derivative,
revenue substition, and revenue decoupling.   Time to put on the economic
thinking cap and green eye shades, because I&#39;m going to marry the Java beans
to the bean counters.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Revenue is a derivative in the new economics of software&lt;/b&gt;.  Jonathan 
has said, publicly and repeatedly (most recently at the press Q&amp;A today)
that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/work/management/2006/05/04/sun-microsystems-schwartz-cz_ec_0504schwartz.html&quot;&gt;
revenue is a lagging indicator&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;ll augment that: revenue is a derivative
of the more proper metrics for a company that is trying to drive growth through
communities.   The independent variable is &lt;i&gt;adoption&lt;/i&gt;: getting people to
use your stuff.   The derivative of adoption is &lt;i&gt;conversion&lt;/i&gt;, or finding
the point at which your kit becomes valuable.  Simon Phipps explains this
in his usual eloquent style in his description of &lt;a href=&quot;
http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/webmink?entry=software_market_3_0&quot;&gt;payment at 
the point of value&lt;/a&gt;.   No matter what you call it, at some point the things
you use become valuable enough that you&#39;re willing to pay, directly or indirectly,
for them to continue at an appropriate quality of service.   And the derivative 
of conversion is &lt;i&gt;monetization&lt;/i&gt;, otherwise known as building a sustained
revenue stream from those customers so converted.   Revenue is a lagging
indicator because it measures the downstream effects only; if you want to see
the upstream potential, you need to look at adoption.   Trying to step off of
the escalators at Moscone today into a sea of people lined up for JavaOne 
technical sessions should give you an idea of why I&#39;m still here.  Independent
variables, not derivative measures.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Making a project available through an open source license causes revenue
substitution&lt;/b&gt;.   The substitution is that revenue is no longer associated with
the initial acquisition of the software, rather, it&#39;s tied to those elements that
drive conversion: support, services, integration, access to deep engineering
talent.   I find it just parallel-universe style confusing that otherwise
intelligent analysts (not the folks at JavaOne, of course!) can say &quot;open
sourcing Java will kill the Java revenue stream&quot; when there are clearly
business models that deliver revenue from open sourced projects (Red Hat,
anyone?)  It&#39;s not the same revenue stream, it&#39;s a stream of dollars that
pay for the &quot;point of value&quot; for those developers, deployers, and intermediaries
who see value in the software.  It&#39;s predicated on creating
specific value that benefits those who start using your software with its
newly reduced barrier to acquisition.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Client revenue has been decoupled from server revenue.&lt;/b&gt;
Call this the &quot;Why Netscape isn&#39;t&quot; effect, because Netscape&#39;s original plan
was to use the freely available, widely distributed browser to drive affinity
for Netscape&#39;s backend web, calendar, and proxy servers.    This model is wrong.
Ed Zander&#39;s 30 million handsets -- a month! -- don&#39;t require any Motorola 
backend.   That&#39;s the opportunity.  This goes far beyond separating Microsoft
clients and Microsoft server solutions; and well past Java ME enabled handsets
talking to a Java Enterprise System backend.    Client revenue is a function 
of the client &lt;i&gt;devices&lt;/i&gt; being sold: PDAs, phones, laptops, SunRays.  
Server-side revenue is a function of the &lt;i&gt;software&lt;/i&gt; delivered over the
network to an increasing extent.   As long as we have simple, thin-waistline
(to borrow Steve Deering&#39;s term) protocols for interoperability of the
clients and servers, they&#39;re decoupled revenue streams.
&lt;p&gt;
I don&#39;t think I can just point tomorrow&#39;s press meetings at this rant,
but I&#39;ll think about.

    <title>JavaOne Opening Act: The Power Of Java</title>

            <description>          Half of the fun of JavaOne is seeing who is sitting in the first two rows, and who
comes by to offer greetings, compliments, criticisms or venture funding.  It&#39;s a
mash-up (literally) of people in suits, people with pony tails, people in sandals,
marketing people, engineers, production folks, and world-class musicians.  Some
people fit more than one profile, which is one of the things that makes JavaOne so much fun.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;width: 320px; height: 240 px;&quot;
src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/roller/resources/stern/katoja.jpg&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
vspace=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
Opening act: Katoja, the Nigerian Highlife Orchestra. Outstandingly good &quot;world
music,&quot; continuing the aural tradition of Papa Wemba and other talent discovered
by ex-Talking Head David Byrne.
&lt;p&gt;
Here&#39;s a secret: I think Jonathan was nervous.  Usually he&#39;s got something
quick and insightful to say during these fly-by meet and greets, but today
was he quiet.   Then again, this was his first gig as bandleader.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;width: 320px; height: 240 px;&quot;
src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/roller/resources/stern/mstage.jpg&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
vspace=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
To get
a feel for his task, though, this is what the big tent at Moscone looked like
10 minutes before Jonathan took the stage.  The room was almost full, and was
completely filled by the time the opening &quot;Power of Java&quot; reel spooled.  The
analogies to a concert aren&#39;t lost here -- everyone wants to see a good show
and (nearly) everyone is here because they want to learn more.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;width: 320px; height: 240 px;&quot;
src=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/roller/resources/stern/marymary.jpg&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
vspace=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
Want to know how &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/mary&quot;&gt;Mary Smaragdis&lt;/a&gt; gets all
of the cool scoops at big shows?  She hangs out in front of the stage monitors,
at least during the pre-show.   Caught her in the act.
&lt;p&gt;
The &quot;Power of Java&quot; video really hit home.   About two dozen people &lt;i&gt;
transparently&lt;/i&gt; using Java to accomplish every day, important things,
from paying a parking meter to getting medical information to sharing bits
with the world.   JavaOne is all about developers, and the how and what of
constructing Java-based systems.  The opening reel showed how those systems
can change the world - the true power of Java.  And before anyone dismisses that
as the rambling of an overly avuncular CTO or nice, foofy Kumbayah talk, it&#39;s
based on exactly the same principles that make &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;
wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; work: People will do things if they&#39;re fun, if they&#39;re doing
social good, and if they can showcase and share their talents.
&lt;p&gt;
The Power of Java is in harnessing that energy and channeling it around
the world.  Then consumers of the technology -- via web browsers, cell
phones, kiosks, desktops, and software delivered as a service -- will
realize that Nigeria is the source of a strong drum-and-bass beat, not just
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secretservice.gov/alert419.shtml&quot;&gt;Section 419&lt;/a&gt; scams.  And that&#39;s music to my ears.

            <description>          Ran into Sun&#39;s account executive for JP Morgan Chase at the Devils game today.
I didn&#39;t mind, especially because the Devils were holding a 3-0 lead at
the time (they went on to win, 5-1).
&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m obviously carrying on about this over on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://agrosnowman.com/snowman&quot;&gt;Snowman Blog&lt;/a&gt;, since the
Devils-Canes series has consumed a lot of my emotional wealth this past week.
But since I worked while supposedly at play, I figured I can plug play at work.
Or something like that.

            <description>          You too can enjoy the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/enviro&quot;&gt;guy 
with the goofy laugh&lt;/a&gt; online.   Dave Douglas has started his Sun blog,
a mere 48 hours after coming on board.   He&#39;s in the blog roll at right.

    <title>Cuban's $100,000 bar for blogging</title>

            <description>          The NBA fined Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks,
$100,000 for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000970073680/&quot;&gt;
blogging about playoff officiating&lt;/a&gt;.  Read the blog.  He offers some concrete
suggestions for improving the quality of the game during a time when
owners, fans, and players are stressed.  
&lt;p&gt;
Ever hear of freedom of the press, David Stern?  And yes, blogs are the press,
they&#39;re the media, and they&#39;re often a better pulse on what&#39;s going on than
the &quot;mainstream&quot; outlets.    Between the NHL&#39;s pseudo-blogs (only people
they select can have blogs show up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nhl.com&quot;&gt;nhl.com&lt;/a&gt;)
and the NBA&#39;s fining of bloggers, I&#39;m starting to think that our major sports
leagues could care less what John Q. Public thinks.   And at $100 per ticket, I&#39;m
far from fine with that.

    <title>Return of Dave Douglas, Woo-Hoo</title>
    <dc:creator>Hal Stern</dc:creator>
    <link>http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/stern?entry=return_of_dave_douglas_woo</link>

            <description>          Dave Douglas has returned to Sun as our VP of Eco-Responsibility.   This
is big news for a few reasons.  First of all, this isn&#39;t just a side interest
for Dave, in his words, he&#39;s able to combine two of the things he loves the
most: technology and the environment.   He really is a mash-up of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Gordon Moore.  Check out his &lt;a href=&quot;http://nearwalden.com/blog/?page_id=2&quot;&gt;
Near Walden&lt;/a&gt; blog for more details.
&lt;p&gt;
Second big reason: Dave is incredibly good at looking across organizations
and boundaries, and figuring out what needs to get done.  He sets agendas.   He&#39;s going to make us think about the environment beyond energy consumption of our CoolThreads servers and RoHaS (Removal of Hazardous Substances) programs.   When
Pfizer designs a drug, they worry about the metabolic by-products so we don&#39;t (literally) crap up the environment.   When technology companies build products,
we don&#39;t necessarily think about what happens when they are used, upgraded or
discarded.  It&#39;s time to think about it.
&lt;p&gt;
Third big reason, and the personal one: Dave is a lot of fun to have around.
I have consistently called him &quot;the Dave Douglas with the dumb laugh&quot; because
he laughs consistently and regularly.   Even though he likes the Red Sox and
the Bruins, he&#39;s good for a beer at the Old Pro in Palo Alto and a non-partisan 
night of sports.   And even more personally, he&#39;s a huge Cam Neely fan, making
him a lifetime member of the Snowman Club, his initiation completed the
night he took his son to watch Neely&#39;s #8 raised to the rafters at the Garden.
&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for coming back to Sun, DD.   The rest of the Earth will thank you later.

    <title>Snail's Pace</title>

    <category>On The Road</category>
            <description>          I&#39;m in the Bay Area for the entire week, attending our first-ever
company wide review of our R&amp;D projects.  It&#39;s been a hectic week and
one with constant note-taking, preparation, cross-referencing and
annotation, as each of the business unit CTOs tries to figure out
where we can find efficiencies in both what we&#39;re doing and how
we&#39;re doing it.
&lt;p&gt;
When I&#39;m gone for a week, I try to pack my in line skates so that
I get something resembling exercise when I&#39;m not playing hockey
or baseball back home.   If I&#39;m checking a big bag of clothes, 
adding skate wear and skates to the mix isn&#39;t so bad, plus I
get the added bonus of clipping my decal-covered helmet to
my carry-on and getting the &quot;You skate, dude?&quot; looks in the airport.
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Skate&quot; is a relative term.  I believe I hold the record for being
tossed out of public places on skates: the Balitmore Inner Harbor park,
the Fort Lauderdale Hard Rock Hotel parking deck, the Point Pleasant, New
Jersey boardwalk and the Atlantic City Hilton hotel.  The last one was
the most amusing: I wanted to take
a break from blading on the famous AC boards and take a break
in the AC of the Hilton, so I switched blades for flip flops and
walked into the casion carrying my skate bag.   I was told (by
security) that my bag was &quot;too big&quot; and was asked to leave.  Realize
that all around me, people with more teeth than fingers, some carrying
a day&#39;s worth of clothing in plastic bags, were greeted
with smiles, but I was suspicious.  
&lt;p&gt;
But I digress.   In the course of skating these public courses, I&#39;ve
had to evade rolling chairs, wheelchairs, cars, buses, traffic cones,
animal droppings, pavement gaps and the occasional live animal.   
This week&#39;s skates around the Sun Menlo Park Campus (perimeter road,
precisely 1 mile) provided a new challenge: snails.  In the morning
hours, it seems the blind, slow-moving, shell-encrusted future
French delicacies move from whatever wetlands lie outside
the parking lot to the trees, sidewalks, pavements and light poles
that dot the inside of the road.   Dodging them made the circle
tour fun.   Unfortunately, after a week of seriously deep technical
review, I wasn&#39;t exactly road racing. 
&lt;p&gt;
The snails were out pacing me.

    <title>Glimpse of Great Scott</title>
    <dc:creator>Hal Stern</dc:creator>
    <link>http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/stern?entry=glimpse_of_great_scott</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2006 08:26:22 -0700</pubDate>
    <category>General</category>
            <description>          Several years ago, Scott McNealy made a sales call with me (and a host of
others) to a prominent NYC investment bank.   Scott had always been
heavily involved with the executive management of this bank, not on
behalf of Sun&#39;s banking business or his own banking, but because
it was good for Sun Microsystems to maintain this kind of relationship.
As a result, he frequently was asked to attend meetings that ranged
from executive board room to engineering bored room.
&lt;p&gt;
Our joint sales call was one of the latter: we met with an absolutely
brilliant bank employee, who discussed matrix math, floating point,
Monte Carlo simulation and the value of epsilon in our hour together.
I enjoyed it as much as Scott endured it; it wasn&#39;t really a great
use of his time.   As we were leaving, Scott turned to me and said
&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here, and I hope you&#39;re learning something, because
this is a bit geeky, even for me&quot;.   And he said it with a smile, and
with complete sincerity -- because nobody was going to get in
trouble for an impedance mismatch on the executive level, or find
that Scott refused future sales calls due to one random
experience.
&lt;p&gt;
Scott has always treated people at
Sun as much as his extended family as his employees.  We goof up,
we get a laugh out of it, and then we go out for McDonald&#39;s (seriously).
Tragically, that bank employee was killed on 9/11/01, and I remember
telling Scott, relating it back to our somewhat comic sales call.
I&#39;m pretty sure Scott already knew the details from his continued
conversations with the customer, but he gave me a look that
conveyed a sense of personal loss.
&lt;p&gt;
That&#39;s what it&#39;s been like to work for Scott for 17 years.
&lt;p&gt;
At this week&#39;s Spring Leadership Conference (also known as the 
&quot;VP Barbeque Event&quot;), one of the tributes to Scott&#39;s leadership
showed him on a magazine cover hugging Jack Welch.   I asked Jonathan,
during open Q&amp;A, who &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; Jack Welch is -- and Jonathan answered
without a femtosecond of hestitation -- Scott McNealy.
&lt;p&gt;
That&#39;s my hopeful glimpse of the next 17 years at Sun.

            <description>           &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/jimmauro&quot;&gt;Jim Mauro&lt;/a&gt; sent me this pointer to
his post-book &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jimmauro?entry=a_tale_of_two_books&quot;&gt;cathartic release&lt;/a&gt;.   If you&#39;re trolling through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensolaris.org&quot;&gt;OpenSolaris&lt;/a&gt; source code, or trying to figure
out why your application seems slow (because you&#39;re using the filesystem badly)
or just want to understand what happens inside a system call (and why repeated system calls are bad for your health), Mauro and McDougall&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Solaris Internals&lt;/i&gt; is the 
book for you.   
&lt;p&gt;
Ultimate props: during next week&#39;s all-Sun R&amp;D review, I&#39;m presenting an overview
of the core components of Solaris.   The lead-in diagram, given to me by the VP 
who runs Solaris engineering, is taken from &lt;i&gt;Solaris Internals&lt;/i&gt;.   
&lt;p&gt;
Congratulations to Jim and company on completing round two in the book business.
Now you can buy me lunch when I&#39;m in Somerset without using the book as
a time sink excuse.

    <title>Thank Your Admins</title>
    <dc:creator>Hal Stern</dc:creator>
    <link>http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/stern?entry=thank_your_admins</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2006 22:54:37 -0700</pubDate>
    <category>General</category>
            <description>          Quiz question: name the one person in your organization known to all
of your customers, most of your superiors, all of your peers and the people who
work for you, and anyone who has even the faintest interest in connecting with you?
&lt;p&gt;
Answer: your administrator.   He or she is the only person that talks to
everyone, and ensures that those people retain some interest in talking
to you.   Your administrator is the public face of your company and 
your role in that company.   Friday concludes &lt;a href=&quot;
http://www.iaap-hq.org/apw/apwindex.htm&quot;&gt;Professional Administrator&#39;s
Week&lt;/a&gt;, so don&#39;t let the chance to say &quot;thank you&quot; slide.
&lt;p&gt;
My administrative assistant, Linda, saves my work or family life
at least once a week.  For a 2:00 AM flight out of Beijing, Linda
noticed that I had been booked a day earlier than I wanted to leave (hmm,
that date change after midnight gets you every time) and made sure I wasn&#39;t
left a stranger in a strange land.   She makes sure I have time to get
from Point A to Point B, whether on foot or in the car, and tries to clear
a path for food in whatever time zone I need to be fed.    Fax, email, phone
or SMS, she knows how to find me appropriately and promptly. 
&lt;p&gt;
Most important, though, is that everyone I meet is quick to tell me that
Linda is wonderful, prompt, polite, creative, and easy to work with.   They&#39;re
right, and not a day goes by when I don&#39;t appreciate those attributes.
&lt;p&gt;
The other person who gets the major kudos today is Karen, Scott McNealy&#39;s 
administrator.   More than a dozen years ago, I made an egregious &lt;i&gt;faux pas&lt;/i&gt;
with a customer, becoming entangled in a political fight 
via a design document (with my name on it) that was used as an
organizational forcing function.  One of the people so forced called 
Scott&#39;s office, looking for my head. 
This is where Karen executed a kick save that
would make Marty Brodeur proud: she informed Scott, got my line of business
VP on the phone, initiated damage control both locally and globally, and
within 24 hours there was a plan to repair the relationship.  The &quot;plan&quot;
mostly involved having me on the receiving end of some deserved dressing-downs,
but had this festered the net result would not have been nearly as good for 
me, for Sun, or for my management chain. 
&lt;p&gt;
To Linda, Karen, and the hundreds of other administrators at Sun,
&quot;thank you.&quot;
