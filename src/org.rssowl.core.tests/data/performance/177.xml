	<description>In his weekly radio address President Bush said, &quot;Al Qaeda is our enemy, and we want to know their plans. The intelligence activities I have authorized are lawful and have been briefed to appropriate members of Congress, both Republican and Democrat. The privacy of all Americans is fiercely protected in all our activities. The government does not listen to domestic phone calls without court approval. We are not trolling through the personal lives of millions of innocent Americans. Our efforts are focused on links to al Qaeda terrorists and its affiliates who want to harm the American people. ... Americans expect their government to do everything in its power under our laws and Constitution to protect them and their civil liberties. That is exactly what we are doing.&quot;</description>

Our unemployment rate is now 4.9 percent, lower than the average rate of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.  Our economy grew at more than 4 percent in the third quarter of 2005, and it has been growing at nearly that rate for two years.  Productivity is high, consumers are confident, and more Americans now own their homes than at any time in our Nation&apos;s history.&quot;</description>

Yet in this first war of the 21st century, one of the most critical battlefronts is the home front.  And since September the 11th, we&apos;ve been on the offensive against the terrorists plotting within our borders.&quot;</description>

And because America stood firm in this important fight, our children and grandchildren will be safer and more secure.&quot;</itunes:summary>

	<description>Our citizens live in freedom because patriots are willing to serve and sacrifice for our liberty.  And on Monday, I will lay a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery in honor of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.  This year marks the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, a victory for freedom in which more than 400,000 Americans gave their lives.  Today a new generation of Americans is making its own sacrifice on behalf of peace and freedom, and some have given their lives.</description>
