<p>Sometimes the best food is really the simplest.  We've been experimenting with different ways of preparing <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?domains=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elise.com&q=pork+chops&sa=Google+Search&client=pub-5527714554151844&forid=1&ie=ISO-8859-1&oe=ISO-8859-1&safe=active&cof=GALT%3A%23660000%3BGL%3A1%3BDIV%3A%23999999%3BVLC%3A336633%3BAH%3Acenter%3BBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BLBGC%3A993300%3BALC%3A003366%3BLC%3A003366%3BT%3A000000%3BGFNT%3A666666%3BGIMP%3A666666%3BFORID%3A1%3B&hl=en&sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elise.com">pork chops</a>, but the way we have pork chops most regularly is with a simple dry rub and pan frying.   My mother's been making chops this way for years.  We use a dry rub of my father's, which requires some advance preparation (when you make some, you make more than you need than for just a few pork chops).  If we are out of the dry rub, mom typically uses a bit of paprika, salt and pepper to season the chops.</p>]]></description>

<p><em>From the recipe archive</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rhubarbinfo.com/">Rhubarb</a> is one of those strange vegetables that acts more like a fruit - the bright pink rhubarb stems that is;  the leaves are poisonous.  Strawberry rhubarb pie is one of my favorite pies in the world; in fact everyone here loves it.  I made this pie for a party and had to make another the next day for my parents, who had heard me talk about it and couldn't believe I hadn't brought them a piece.  We ended up making 3 pies this last week, one using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0883659581/elisecom">James Beard</a> recipe, another a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0936184744/elisecom">Best Recipe</a> recipe, and the third what we thought ended up being the best combination.  It's a little bit tricky because depending on how sweet your strawberries are, you'll need more or less sugar.  We found the ratio of 3 to 1, rhubarb to strawberries, yielded the most flavorful results.</p>]]></description>

<p>If you look up lots of recipes online, and then add them to your favorites, sooner or later your favorites list can get a little unwieldy.  The solution?  Check out the social bookmarking site <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>.  I recently started using <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> to keep track of promising links from other sites, as well as indexing almost all of the recipes on Simply Recipes.  My "virtual cookbook" (<a href="http://del.icio.us/elisebauer/recipes">http://del.icio.us/elisebauer/recipes</a>) has over 300 recipes and new ones are a breeze to add.</p>]]></description>

<p>Do you love oatmeal?  Do you love pancakes?  You should try them when they are one and the same.  Seriously.  Dee Johnston whipped up her favorite family recipe for a recent gathering of friends and this is now my new favorite pancake.  Great smothered with butter and maple syrup (of course) and also leftover strawberries from <a href="http://www.elise.com/recipes/archives/000270strawberry_shortcake.php">strawberry shortcake</a>.  A little advanced planning is necessary as the oats must soak in buttermilk overnight. Yummmmm....</p>]]></description>

<p>The Swiss chard I planted last spring survived the winter to vigorously return this year.  Last week we made a <a href="http://www.elise.com/recipes/archives/001882swiss_chard_tzatziki_yogurt_dip.php">yogurt dip</a> with the leaves of some swiss chard I picked.  The ribs from that bunch went into this dish, which was so good we ate it up before I could get a photo.  The basic recipe for the chard comes from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039470780X/elisecom">The Victory Garden Cookbook</a>.  Just straight with the cream and butter, the chard is too rich, but mixed in with pasta (we used rice penne pasta) it is superb.</p>]]></description>

<p>My grandmother, on my dad's side, had an amazing sweet tooth.  How that woman could eat as many jelly-filled donuts as she did and still live to 97, I'll never know.  One of her favorite pies to make for us was <b>grasshopper pie</b>, a chilled minty green pie with an oreo cookie crust.  I haven't found her recipe, but my father patched one together from many he found online that turns out a pie just like the one she used to make.  Many grasshopper pie recipes are quite elaborate and call for gelatin, egg yolks, egg whites, etc.  In this recipe we use marshmallows, which are essentially sugar and gelatin, and no eggs.</p>]]></description>

<p>What happens when you get a dozen women together for a weekend in the Sierras, sans kids and husbands?  A lot of gabbing,  cooking, reading, eating, <a href="http://www.websudoku.com/">sudoku</a>, and walking.  Did I already mention eating?  and cooking?  This was my first time up for my friend <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?domains=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elise.com&q=suzanne&sa=Google+Search&client=pub-5527714554151844&forid=1&ie=ISO-8859-1&oe=ISO-8859-1&safe=active&cof=GALT%3A%23660000%3BGL%3A1%3BDIV%3A%23999999%3BVLC%3A336633%3BAH%3Acenter%3BBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BLBGC%3A993300%3BALC%3A003366%3BLC%3A003366%3BT%3A000000%3BGFNT%3A666666%3BGIMP%3A666666%3BFORID%3A1%3B&hl=en&sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elise.com">Suzanne's</a> annual Alta Ladies Weekend and I don't think I was used to being around so many women who loved to cook!

San Francisco blogger <a href="http://fogcity.blogs.com/jen/">Jennifer Maiser</a> is reprising <a href="http://www.elise.com/recipes/archives/001314august_eat_local_challenge.php">last year's effort</a> with the launch of this month's <a href="http://www.eatlocalchallenge.com/">Eat Local Challenge</a>.  Check out the site and the ways that you can support your local growers. </p>

<p>Those of you who have been following the Simply Recipes site for a while know that we grow a lot of our own food here.  What you may not know is that for as long as I can remember someone from our family (usually dad) has gone to the local farmer's market every Saturday morning to buy our greens and vegetables for the week.  I can even remember accompanying my parents to the Farmer's Market on Fairfax in Miracle Mile in Los Angeles from the time I was five years old.  Why?  Not for any political reason, but just because the food was better and cheaper than what we could get in the stores.  In the last 40 years we as a culture have become even more separated from the process of how we get the food we eat.  Buying food directly from local growers is a great way to reconnect and remember where and how we get our food.  And it's still better quality, and it's still less expensive.<br style="clear: both;"/></p>]]></description>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzatziki">Tzatziki</a> is a Greek dip made with yogurt, olive oil, garlic, and cucumbers.  This version (from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NIOA/elisecom">Martha Stewart Living</a>)  replaces the cucumbers with Swiss chard and is delightful with toasted pita.  Dad announced a couple weeks ago that he didn't like chard (my response - huh?  since when?) and then proceeded to eat most of the tzatziki.  </p>]]></description>

<p>Following <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/13/dining/cooking/13tagine-lamb.html?ex=1146715200&en=939450e8e4f5aa1f&ei=5070">this recipe</a> from the NY Times the other day, I made a sweet lamb stew with honey, almonds, and apricots.  The stew is a traditional lamb tagine called Mrouzia, prepared throughout North Africa during Ramadan.  I had several problems with the NY Times recipe, the first being that although the recipe calls for 3 lbs of lamb, if you look at the video instructions on the NY Times site, the chef is clearly using at least 4 lbs of lamb and is using 6 cups of stock to go with it.  I used only 2 lbs of lamb, reduced the stock required by a third, and it still took way too long to reduce to the proper consistency.  The stew is also very sweet.  Apparently a Mrouzia uses a lot of honey as a way to help preserve the meat in places without refrigeration.  But, that's not a problem here, and all that honey just makes it seem unbalanced.  Finally, I messed up and used regular whole raw almonds instead of blanched almonds (without skins).  I don't think it makes much of a difference, but every recipe I checked calls for blanched almonds.</p>

<p>The stew was actually terrific, especially after I balanced the sweetness a little with some fresh squeezed lemon juice.  It is highly flavorful and very rich.  What follows are the proportions of ingredients that I would use the next time I make this stew - less stock, a lot less honey and a little lemon to balance the sweetness.</p>]]></description>

<p>Guacamole, a dip made from avocados, is originally from Mexico.  The name is derived from two Aztec Nahuatl words - <b>ahuacatl</b> (avocado) and <b>molli</b> (sauce).  The trick to perfect guacamole is using good, ripe avocados.  Check for ripeness by gently pressing the outside of the avocado.  If there is no give, the avocado is not ripe yet and will not taste good.  If there is a little give, the avocado is ripe.  If there is a lot of give, the avocado may be past ripe and not good.   In this case, taste test first before using.</p>]]></description>

<p>Enchiladas were a family staple growing up, though thankfully this cheese enchilada recipe has much less fat in it these days.  Mom tells the story about how in the Sixties my Aunt Josephine went out to eat at a new supposedly Mexican food restaurant in Boston, only to be fed enchiladas where the corn tortillas had been taken out of a package and had not been fried before being cooked with cheese and sauce.  (You have to re-cook the tortillas to soften them up and give them more flavor.) She then went into the restaurant's kitchen and taught the chef how to properly make an enchilada.  My aunt and my mother, both fifth generation hispanic Arizonians, learned this recipe from my grandmother.  Note that there are many kinds of enchiladas - green chile, shrimp, red chili - to name a few.  This recipe just happens to be our favorite one.</p>]]></description>
