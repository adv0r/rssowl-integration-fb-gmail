	Boy genius.

	First blogging billionaire?

		<description><![CDATA[	Even those of us who consider ourselves semi-pro television watchers might have trouble keeping up with the densely packed metaphors, call-backs, and foreshadowing in each episode of The Sopranos.

	The SF Chronicle&#8217;s Tim Goodman does a great job of calling out a few items you might have missed in his blog.

	He wastes no time pointing out [...]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[	Put togther crib. Check.

	Take child safety courses. Check.

	Be told by 15,000 people that we&#8217;re gonna be tired. Check.

	Diapers, bottles, blankets, clothes, changing table. Check, check, check, check, check.

	It still feels like there&#8217;s something I&#8217;m forgetting. Hmmmm.

	Oh yeah. The last detail before we&#8217;re ready for Herschel.

	Check.

		<description><![CDATA[	There was a time, not too long ago when one could have argued that a really top notch appearance on SNL could&#8217;ve saved Al Gore.

	Who would&#8217;ve thought that by the time this week&#8217;s show hit the air, the opposite would be true.

	Al Gore rescued SNL.

		<description><![CDATA[	Well, I guess I won&#8217;t be able to give my five word acceptance speech for my Webby Award over at Rollyo as I was robbed in favor of some rinky dink site called Google.

	I guess I will go with one of my alternate 5 word speeches:

	I am one of your most loyal users and evangelists. Some people couldn&#8217;t imagine marrying someone from another religion or political party. I couldn&#8217;t imagine marrying a Windows user.

		<description><![CDATA[	Mahmoud Ahmadinejad clearly wants to be famous. And this kind of megalomania is a key driver behind the psyches of really bad leaders on the international stage.

	To a certain extent, the Bush administration has probably helped to kickstart the effort. But this dude wants the world&#8217;s attention in a big way and that&#8217;s always bad [...]]]></description>
