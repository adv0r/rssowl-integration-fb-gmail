<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img title="Frosting" alt="Frosting" src="http://www.thefoodsection.com/photos/uncategorized/frosting.jpg" border="0" /> </p>

<p>I love frosting. <em>Love</em> frosting. Which—I know—in these days of cupcake mania, is pretty run of the mill. Every time I turn around there’s another new retro bakery peddling little cakes with a big dollop of pastel goo. But what I really love, specifically, is <em>cheap</em> frosting. I actually dislike real buttercream. I can’t stand the density of powdered sugar and butter icing (e.g. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684859106/104-9106191-0938364?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Magnolia Bakery’s</a>), or the hardened-butter texture of a shiny—<em>slimy!</em> —buttercream frosting, the real kind made with sugar syrup and eggs (e.g. the <a href="http://www.cupcakecafe.com/">Cupcake Café’s</a>).</p>

<p>I admit it: I prefer fake frosting. Canned ready-to-spread frosting. And since I’m telling it all, what I especially enjoy is <a href="http://www.bettycrocker.com/products/prod_frosting.asp?Advertisements=HPMayWhippedFrostingAd&amp;MSCSProfile=3C79F0C7EA3162B2F284847AD36A6DE6AF92E94E956D3FABC03AABDE3297FDFD6F2031F7773B27D16E65AE30C15404838CBE826560639AC34C762155A9DB83FCDCA3970E170D519BFCDF4BD12965D9D6A4BE9CED4C570BCFD064E156FF8E4B414664AF2E24F8E78007C6CD940A1C1A554FCFA5817607A2D97AD42622B5B99ABE">Betty Crocker’s Whipped Frosting</a> in that brilliant artificial flavor General Mills has dubbed &quot;Fluffy White.&quot; Who knew fluffy white had a taste? But it does, and it’s delicious.</p>]]>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img title="Of Mayo and Macedonia" alt="Macedonia2" src="http://www.thefoodsection.com/photos/uncategorized/macedonia2.jpg" border="0" /> </p>

<p>I was invited to go to Macedonia recently, but I realized that I had only the vaguest idea of where Macedonia is actually located on a map. I suspected that it was one of the many little countries that spun off from the former Yugoslavia, and I did recall some distant association with Alexander the Great. But the only immediate association I could make to Macedonia was…salad. </p>

<p>In Italian, a <em>macedonia</em> is a fruit salad, and in French, a <em>salade macédoine</em> is a vegetable salad. In fact, in France, it’s a classic institutional appetizer, served in the finest school cafeterias and consisting of cooked peas, carrots, green beans and turnips in a heavy mayonnaise dressing that looks like white sludge and, as I recall from my elementary school days in France, tastes just as good (here's a <a href="http://www.martinet.fr/fr/produits/fiche.phtml?f=13">commercial version</a>, minus the sludge). </p>

<p>So where the hell <em>is</em> Macedonia? And how it is that chopped carrots and peas and pears and peaches can all somehow claim to be Macedonian? It turns out Macedonia is actually wedged way down in Southeastern Europe between Serbia, Albania and Greece, that the national diet tends massively toward barbecued meat, and that there wasn’t a single Macedonian salad on any of the menus in the many restaurants I sampled there. </p>

<p>What I did find in Macedonia, however, is an unbelievable hodge-podge of ethnicities. The country that calls itself Macedonia today is actually populated by one quarter ethnic Albanians, two-thirds ethnic Macedonians, equal sprinklings of Serbs, Bulgarians and Roma, and a substantial serving of Turks. Add to that a seasoning of intense religious diversity—one-third Muslims, two-thirds Macedonian Orthodox, and a potent dash of Albanian Catholics—and suddenly you begin to understand why the term <em>macédoine</em> in diplomatic history is synonymous with “complicated mixture.” If, over its many centuries of ethnic conflict, Macedonia has come be known as the “tinderbox of the Balkans,” it’s because no amount of mayonnaise dressing could ever make the ethnic peas identify with the ethnic carrots, or make the green beans speak the turnips’ language. </p>

<p>So a Macedonian salad, in the end, is just a mixed salad. A salad with a diversity of similar ingredients—fruits, veggies, warring ethnicities, whatever. And it also turns out that the sludgy mayonnaise dressing part of the <em>salade macédoine</em> is just some French lunch-lady’s idea that everything tastes better with mayonnaise. </p>

<p>Below, a recipe for a seasonal macédoine of spring vegetables. Hold the mayo. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to welcome Renée Kaplan as a guest editor who will be contributing a series of guest posts to <em>The Food Section.</em></p>

<p>Ms. Kaplan is a writer and television producer in New York. Her first novel, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=thefoodsectio-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0425202402%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1147274816%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">Shaking Her Assets</a></em> (Berkley Trade), came out in May 2005, and her most recent writing appears in the just-released anthology <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=thefoodsectio-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1933368241%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1147274992%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8">Half/Life: Jewish Tales from Interfaith Homes</a> </em>(Soft Skull Press). She is currently a news producer for CNN, previously produced for “60 Minutes II,” and before working in television journalism was a writer and editor for the <em>New York Observer</em>.</p>

<p>Born in upstate New York, Ms. Kaplan grew up between Ithaca and Paris, France, which probably made her the only kid in midde school who knew more about Michelin stars than the teen ones. She says it wasn't good for her popularity, but it fostered a life-long passion for thinking, writing, and reading about food. In addition, as the daughter of an expert of French bread, she has been talking about the mouthfeel of crust and the alveolage of the crumb since her mother started her on solids.</p>

<p>Look for her first post -- on a curious French salad -- to appear later today.</p>]]>

<p>On Monday night, The James Beard Foundation wrapped up its two-day awards ceremony recognizing excellence in journalism and the food industry.</p>

<p>The awards ceremony for journalists took place on Sunday. Notably, the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> took the award for Best Newspaper Food Section, and David Leite's <a href="http://www.leitesculinaria.com/">Leite's Culinaria</a> received the award for best Website for Food, a new category offered this year. For more details on the winners in all categories, head to <a href="http://poynter.org/forum/view_post.asp?id=11404">Romenesko</a> (via <a href="http://eater.curbed.com/archives/2006/05/beard_journalis.php">eater</a>). </p>

<p>Cookbook authors, chefs, and restaurants were honored on Monday. <em>Hungry Planet: What the World Eats,</em> by Peter Menzel and Faith D'Aluisio, won Cookbook of the Year. Among the other <a href="http://www.jamesbeard.org/awards/awards.php?year=2006&amp;category=1">cookbook winners</a> were Suzanne Goin, who won for her <em>Sunday Suppers at Lucques</em> in the Cooking from a Professional Point of View category, Jill Norman, whose <em>The Cook's Book</em> won in the general category, and Mario Batali, who took the prize for International Cookbook for <em>Molto Italiano</em>.</p>

<p>Among the <a href="http://www.jamesbeard.org/awards/awards.php?year=2006&amp;category=3">chefs and restaurants</a> honored were <span face="Arial">Gotham Bar &amp; Grill's Alfred Portale, who took home the award for Outstanding Chef, Danny Meyer, who won the Best New Restaurant award for The Modern, and Blue Hill's Dan Barber, who won for Best Chef: New York.</span></p>

<p><span face="Arial">For more on the rest of the winners, sort through <a href="http://www.jamesbeard.org/awards/index.php">pages</a> of the James Beard Foundation website. Or, better yet, peruse food writer/blogger Ed Levine's <a href="http://www.edlevineeats.com/post/488">live-blogging</a> of the event -- from the thrill of victory (&quot;Best Chef NY - Dan Barber. I predicted this one. He is one of the most thoughtful and articulate chefs around.&quot;) to the agony of defeat (&quot;Writings About Food. Kitchen Sisters did not win this one either. There is no justice.&quot;).</span></p>

<p><span face="Arial"><strong>Update:</strong> Fresh from the press release, a complete listing of all the winners, after the jump. </span></p>]]>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img title="Edible Brooklyn" height="260" alt="Edible Brooklyn" src="http://www.thefoodsection.com/foodsection/images/ediblebrooklyn.jpg" width="350" border="0" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ediblecommunities.com/">Edible Communities</a>, the national network of regional food magazines, has launched a Brooklyn edition published by the folks behind <em><a href="http://www.edibleeastend.com/">Edible East End</a></em>, another Edible Communities publication covering the Hamptons and the North Fork.</p>

<p>Of the new magazine, editor Gabrielle Langholtz writes: &quot;<a href="http://ediblebrooklyn.net/"><em>Edible Brooklyn</em></a> is much more than glam shots and restaurant reviews. This is a magazine with an opinion, one that advocates for sustaining agriculture, for relishing tradition, for seeking out taste experiences, and for pulling back the curtain on where Brooklyn's food comes from and how it got here.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ediblebrooklyn.net/pages/articles/spring2006/spring06toc.htm">premier issue</a> include stories on smoked fish in Greenpoint, DUMBO's Jacques Torres Chocolates, and Gomberg Seltzer Works, one of the borough's last remaining seltzer delivery operations. Naturally, They Might Be Giants makes an appearance (this <em>is</em> a Brooklyn mag, after all) in an article cataloguing the contents of &quot;The Brooklyn Fridge&quot; of band member John Flansburgh.</p>

<p><em>Edible Brooklyn</em>, published quarterly, is distributed for free at Brooklyn shops and restaurants and is available by subscription for $28 annually.</p>]]>

<p>It's that time of year where I get up early and -- camera in hand -- take a meandering walk through Central Park on the way to work in an attempt to capture the riot of spring color. Luckily, I took these photos last Thursday morning, when the weather was still beautiful. Who knows how these flowering trees fared after this wet and windy weekend.</p>
