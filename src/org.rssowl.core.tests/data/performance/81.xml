The vulnerabilities are documented in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin. These vulnerabilities are also documented in Macromedia Security Bulletin MPSB05-07 for customers using Flash Player 5 and 6. Customers who have installed Flash Player 7 and higher are advised to download the latest version from the Adobe website. Customers that have followed the guidance in Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-03 are not at risk from the vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.</description><link>http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-020.mspx?pubDate=2006-05-09</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-020.mspx</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2006 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>MS06-019: Vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Could Allow Remote Code Execution (916803)</title><description>Bulletin Severity Rating:Critical - This update resolves a newly-discovered, privately-reported vulnerability.
