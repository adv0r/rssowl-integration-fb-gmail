         <title>Republicans Insist Congressional Offices off Limits to Searches</title>
         <link>http://feeds.wizbangblog.com/WizbangFullFeed?m=1287</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;House Speaker Dennis Hastert and House Leader John Boehner displayed a sickening amount of arrogance when they said the search of Rep. Jefferson's office was unconstitutional and that the documents retrieved at Rep. Jefferson's office &lt;a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/05/24/D8HQ79QG2.html"&gt;should be returned&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the color of the sky in their world?  The FBI got the appropriate warrant signed by a judge. If this action were unconstitutional wouldn't the judge have refused to sign the warrant for that reason?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, as &lt;a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGY2MTMxNjZhMGRmNDU5MDZhMWIyNWNhNzJhNDFhNzY="&gt;Byron York&lt;/a&gt; points out, the FBI officials tried several times to get the information they needed outside of getting a search warrant, but they were refused every time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, it should be said that prosecutors seem to have Jefferson dead to rights. They have -- and have had since late last summer -- more than enough evidence to justify a search of his office. In the last months, they have apparently tried other, more standard, means to try to get Jefferson to comply with requests to turn over the evidence, to no avail. There is even, in the 95-page search warrant request, a section headlined GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO EXHAUST ALL LESSER INTRUSIVE APPROACHES TO OBTAINING RELEVANT DOCUMENTS AND RECORDS LOCATED IN THE WASHINGTON, D.C. CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE OF WILLIAM J. JEFFERSON. It is followed by several redacted paragraphs in which prosecutors apparently describe their attempts to get Jefferson to turn over information.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did Dennis Hastert and John Boehner expect the FBI  to do? Accept Rep. Jefferson's refusal to hand over the information it needed and just ignore the entire situation? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, If we took Hastert's and Boehner's  statements to their most logical conclusion, any member of congress could blatantly commit any crime in his or her office and he or she would be immune from a search.  Daffydd at &lt;a href="http://biglizards.net/blog/archives/2006/05/criminal_schrim.html"&gt;Big Lizards&lt;/a&gt;  argues this point as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;They are saying that if Marion Barry were elected to Congress, he could sit there in his congressional office, in full view of God and Man, openly smoking crack and shooting up heroin... and the FBI, the DEA, and the Capitol Police could only stand helplessly watching. So long as he kept his stash in the office, he needn't even hide it -- because Congress has a private law that says "what happens under the Dome stays under the Dome."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have they completely forgotten what is being investigated here? Rep. Jefferson was caught on video accepting a $100,000 bribe and $90,000 was found in his office. Where's the outrage about that?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

         <title>Not To alarm anyone, but...</title>
         <link>http://feeds.wizbangblog.com/WizbangFullFeed?m=1286</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;Democrats, I beg you to puhleeeeeeze let Al Gore be your nominee again.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if he were to win the nomination we would have to watch media types like Katie Couric gush all over him  &lt;a href="http://newsbusters.org/node/5511"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt; nonstop and we would have to hear urgent global warming warnings everyday.  It seems to me a small price to pay, but decide for yourselves.  Here is a bit from the Today show segment, courtesy of  &lt;a href="http://newsbusters.org"&gt;Newsbusters&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There's really not a debate. The debate's over. The scientific community has reached as strong a consensus as you will ever find in science. There are a few oil companies and coal companies that spend millions of dollars a year to put these pseudo-scientists out there predending there is a debate. It's exactly the same thing that the tobacco companies did after the Surgeon General warned us about the linkage between smoking and lung cancer." 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Having timidly trotted out the other side of the argument, Couric left no doubt where she stands: "Where there is disagreement among scientists is not if but when we may see drastic environmental changes across the globe. Al Gore says the clock is ticking." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
She later asked: "What do you see happening in say 15 to 20 years or even 50 years if nothing changes?" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Gore: "Well, what I think is going to happen is that we're going to respond to it. But if we didn't respond, what you would find is desertification of the mid-continental areas of the U.S., Europe, Asia and Africa. The melting of the polar ice cap and the beginnings of the same things in Antarctica and sea level increases of 20 feet or more worldwide. Of course Florida and Louisiana and Texas are particularly vulnerable. The San Francisco Bay area. Manila, and we have seen the impact of a couple of hundred thousand refugees from an environmental crisis [as pictures of Katrina victims flashed on the screen]. Imagine 100 million or 200 million." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Couric: "Even Manhattan would be in deep water, right?" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Gore: "Yes, the World Trade Center memorial site would be underwater." &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Can we just go ahead and nickname him Al the Alarmist and get it over with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:  Really, it would be so much fun to run against &lt;a href="http://www.anklebitingpundits.com/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3619"&gt;this guy &lt;/a&gt;again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

         <description>&lt;p&gt;I don't know whether this says more about Hillary's popularity in the South or the level of competence of those promoting the Hillarynow.com website.

         <link>http://feeds.wizbangblog.com/WizbangFullFeed?m=1284</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;When a lawyer takes a case, they are obligated to see it through to the end. Especially a criminal case. And if the case is as serious as a murder case, the burden on the attorney is tremendous. Should the lawyer attempt to get out of defending their client, it takes a great deal to persuade the judge to let the attorney off the hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think &lt;a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=140573"&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt; has a pretty good argument for being removed from his client's case...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

         <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/opinion/24meese.html"&gt;Ed Meese's OP/ED&lt;/a&gt; in today's New York Times. He calls the current immigration proposals what they are: amnesty:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since he was with President Reagan when he signed the 1986 amnesty bill into law, Meese knows amnesty when he sees it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the mid-80's, many members of Congress -- pushed by the Democratic majority in the House and the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy -- advocated amnesty for long-settled illegal immigrants. President Reagan considered it reasonable to adjust the status of what was then a relatively small population, and I supported his decision.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In exchange for allowing aliens to stay, he decided, border security and enforcement of immigration laws would be greatly strengthened -- in particular, through sanctions against employers who hired illegal immigrants. If jobs were the attraction for illegal immigrants, then cutting off that option was crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, most illegal immigrants who could establish that they had resided in America continuously for five years would be granted temporary resident status, which could be upgraded to permanent residency after 18 months and, after another five years, to citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this path to citizenship was not automatic. Indeed, the legislation stipulated several conditions: &lt;strong&gt;immigrants had to pay application fees, learn to speak English, understand American civics, pass a medical exam and register for military selective service. Those with convictions for a felony or three misdemeanors were ineligible. Sound familiar? These are pretty much the same provisions included in the new Senate proposal and cited by its supporters as proof that they have eschewed amnesty in favor of earned citizenship.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is that &lt;strong&gt;President Reagan called this what it was: amnesty.&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, look up the term "amnesty" in Black's Law Dictionary, and you'll find it says, "the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act provided amnesty for undocumented aliens already in the country." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the amnesty bill of 1986, the current Senate proposal would place those who have resided illegally in the United States on a path to citizenship, provided they meet a similar set of conditions and pay a fine and back taxes. The illegal immigrant does not go to the back of the line but gets immediate legalized status, while law-abiding applicants wait in their home countries for years to even get here. And that's the line that counts. In the end, slight differences in process do not change the overriding fact that the 1986 law and today's bill are both amnesties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a practical problem as well: the 1986 act did not solve our illegal immigration problem. From the start, there was widespread document fraud by applicants. Unsurprisingly, the number of people applying for amnesty far exceeded projections. And there proved to be a failure of political will in enforcing new laws against employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a six-month slowdown that followed passage of the legislation, illegal immigration returned to normal levels and continued unabated. Ultimately, some 2.7 million people were granted amnesty, and many who were not stayed anyway, forming the nucleus of today's unauthorized population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we are, 20 years later, having much the same debate and being offered much the same deal in exchange for promises largely dependent on the will of future Congresses and presidents. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Attorney General Meese is right. The 1986 amnesty law didn't solve the illegal alien problem; it, unfortunately, exacerbated it, and the immigration reform bills that include a path to citizenship will do the same. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former AG Meese is holding a blogger only conference call later this morning, and I am participating. I am anxious to hear what he has to say. I will provide a report later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I participated in a blogger conference call earlier this morning with former Attorney General Ed Meese and Matt Spalding from the Heritage Foundation. As I mentioned earlier in the post, the issue was immigration reform. Mr. Meese is highly critical of the Senate's amnesty bill that is riddled with loopholes asking to be exploited.  How? Well, the Senate's bill  calls for a &lt;a href="http://www.denverpost.com/nationworld/ci_3812704"&gt;three-tier system&lt;/a&gt; (H/T to Right Wing News for link). Take a look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The bill would create a three-tier system for illegal immigrants seeking to stay in the country. People who could prove they have been here five or more years could apply for citizenship. Those who have lived here two to five years could stay as guest workers and later apply for citizenship.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do illegal immigrants prove they have been in this country for five  or more years? By providing an affidavit from a friend. That's it. Document fraud would be rampant. In addition, the Senate's bill would prevent local law enforcement from arresting illegal immigrants for being in this country illegally.  Hamstringing local law officials is not  enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Meese advocates an idea that would secure and enforce the border &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;. See Mr. Meese's and Mr. Spalding's article on their immigration plan published in March 2006 &lt;a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/GovernmentReform/bg1911.cfm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Meese acknowledged that after the amnesty law of 1986 was implemented, which called for a large increase in border securty, the US government was not motivated to actually enforce its own laws.  However, with the technology we have today, Mr. Meese believes that border security should be easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only after the border has been secured will the temporary worker program be implemented, and as a pilot program first.  There is a possibility that the private sector could offer assistance in helping illegals return to their home countries and reapply for temporary worker status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way this plan can work is if the 12 million people currently in this country illegally self-deport back to their home countries.  The illegals who are here have grown roots in their communities. I'm not convinced that they will voluntarily uproot themselves and their families and self-deport to avoid the risk of deportation, which they don't seem to think of as a huge risk right now. However, Mr. Meese said that the risk of not self-deporting will be greater than it is now and that there will be a stronger interior enforcement against employers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temporary worker program that Mr. Meese recommends is modeled after &lt;a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/GovernmentReform/hl924.cfm"&gt;Helen Krieble&lt;/a&gt;'s idea of a market based solution. Private employment agencies would match up employees with employers. &lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Senate Intelligence Committee Endorses Gen. Hayden</title>
         <link>http://feeds.wizbangblog.com/WizbangFullFeed?m=1282</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;The Senate Intelligence Committee endorsed General Michael Hayden as CIA director with a vote of 12 - 3. That's a pretty strong approval considering all the controversy that erupted early on about having a military man running the civilian CIA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the NY Times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/washington/24intel.html?ex=1306123200&amp;en=368e7611420a9ce9&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss"&gt;WASHINGTON, May 23&lt;/a&gt; -- The Senate Intelligence Committee strongly endorsed Gen. Michael V. Hayden on Tuesday to be the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency, with all but three members, all Democrats, voting to send General Hayden's nomination to the Senate floor.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The panel's 12-to-3 vote virtually guarantees that General Hayden will win confirmation by the full Senate, which is likely to vote on his selection before the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the current C.I.A. director, Porter J. Goss, planning to leave the agency on Friday, the White House had urged the Senate to move quickly on General Hayden's confirmation. The vote on Tuesday came just 15 days after President Bush nominated General Hayden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four committee Democrats joined all eight Republican members in endorsing the general. Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas and the panel's chairman, called General Hayden "a proven leader and a supremely qualified intelligence professional."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The committee's vice chairman, John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, said General Hayden had shown "the necessary independence that is essential to restoring the C.I.A.'s credibility and stature." &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there were the typical Democrat holdouts that hung their hats on the NSA Terrorist Surveillance program and the Phone Call Database program as reasons for not endorsing him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Democrats who voted against the nomination were Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Evan Bayh of Indiana. Each cited concerns about General Hayden's role in a controversial domestic surveillance program he ran while head of the National Security Agency.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"I am not convinced that the nominee respects the rule of law and Congress's oversight responsibilities," Mr. Feingold said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Feingold decided a while a ago that he was going to play to the far left wing of the Democratic party by pushing the lie that the NSA's national security programs are illegal. He introduced a &lt;a href="http://www.senate.gov/~feingold/releases/06/03/20060312.html"&gt;motion to censure&lt;/a&gt; President Bush for the &lt;em&gt;completely legal &lt;/em&gt;NSA Terrorist Surveillance program.  His vote against General Hayden was expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay at &lt;a href="http://stoptheaclu.com/archives/2006/05/23/aclu-disappointed-by-committee-vote-of-support-for-general-hayden/"&gt;Stop the ACLU&lt;/a&gt; says the ACLU is alarmed by General Hayden's approval by the Senate Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John at &lt;a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/014167.php"&gt;Power Line&lt;/a&gt; notes that even when President Bush's nominee sails through with such a lopsided vote, CNN still favors the minority opinion. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

         <title>What happens when the government tries to "suggest" things</title>
         <link>http://feeds.wizbangblog.com/WizbangFullFeed?m=1281</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;I have no children, but I think it's fairly safe for me to say that, in most cases, children should be breast-fed over given formula. Repeated studies have shown that, as a general principle, breast milk from the mother is superior to store-bought food. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government of Massachusetts saw the same studies, and decided that it should urge mothers to nurse their children over buying formula. But that wasn't good enough for some Massachusetts officials. They thought that their recommendation was so important, they decided to put a little force behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Massachusetts, new mothers are given a "gift bag" by the hospital, one that contains a bunch of stuff they might find useful. Included was some formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say "was" because in December the state's Public Health Council decided to encourage new mothers to eschew formula by banning hospitals from including free formula in the bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor Romney didn't like that decision. He raised some heck (he's a Mormon, so I really shouldn't say "raised hell") with the Council, urging them to reconsider their policy in no uncertain terms. &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/05/24/state_allows_gifts_of_formula_for_infants/"&gt;They eventually did&lt;/a&gt;, but not before three of their number (the board has nine members) were informed that they would not be re-appointed by the Governor to continue to serve on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boston Glob seems to be taking the side of the board members who lost their seats, but in this case I think Romney was right. These board members had crossed a line -- they had taken their "recommendation" and tried to impose their beliefs into force. They had abused their authority, and as such Romney was not only right to remove them, but was obligated to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking people to "recommend" practices when they have the power to enforce that "recommendation" is a dangerous thing. The inclination to make sure people "do what they should" is a powerful one, and one that must be resisted. People have the right to be wrong, and government has no business protecting them from their own mistakes to that degree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legislature has reworked the board, doubling its membership, changing the requirements to serve, and altering how members are appointed. Time will tell whether it will be an actual improvement, but based on my own observations, I feel fairly safe in predicting that it will not work out well. I strongly suspect that the changes were enacted for purely political reasons: the move was seen as a victory for Romney, the Republican governor, and whether or not the results are good, such things must not stand unchallenged. In other words: screw the mothers and babies, we can't let a Republican look good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I could be wrong. But being cynical when it comes to interpreting the acts of Massachusetts Democrats is usually the safe way to go. (See: Kennedy, Edward Moore; Kerry, John Francis; and Dukakis, Michael Stanley, just to name three nationally-known examples.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

         <title>Does This Mean We Have Won?</title>
         <link>http://feeds.wizbangblog.com/WizbangFullFeed?m=1280</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2006/05/us-great-britain-will-start-iraq-exit.html"&gt;Jim Hoft &lt;/a&gt;has a good writeup on the report that President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair are preparing to announce upcoming "drastic" troop withdrawals from Iraq.  Via &lt;a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,19238188-601,00.html"&gt; The Australian&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;US and British officials hope Britain's 8000 troops in Iraq can be cut to 5000 by the end of the year and the US's 133,000 troops to about 100,000. Iraqi security forces could be in charge of much of the country by the year's end. 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Buoyed by the formation of Iraq's new unity Government at the weekend, senior officials travelling with Mr Blair said all foreign troops should be out of the country within four years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Blair is to hold further discussions on withdrawal at a White House summit with Mr Bush later this week. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to that report, Jim Hoft says, "Boy, it's going to be interesting to see the reaction to this news! ...I guess that means, we won, huh?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will likely catch some flack for this, but my response to Jim would be that not only have we won, but we won some time ago.   In fact, I would argue that we won it back when President Bush strapped on that flight suit and landed on the aircraft carrier in front of the "Mission Accomplished" sign.  There were many additional battles yet to be fought, and very sadly there were many more lives to be lost, but from that point on, instead of us fighting to win the war, we started fighting to keep from losing it.  That is a very important point to make.  Regrettably, many of those battles were ones fought here in the arena of public opinion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past three years, some Democrats have seemed determined to do whatever it took to see us lose in Iraq, whether it be by demoralizing the troops in harm's way or calling for us to cut and run.  Their efforts stand in stark contrast to those of the President and the military who have insisted all along that we were winning and that if we would stay the course until the country was stable enough, and the Iraqis ready to take back control, that victory would be ours.  Don't forget, there were some that declared we were losing in the earliest days in Afghanistan and in the sandstorms on the road to Baghdad.  Some of those people will never, under any circumstances, admit that we have won.  That is something that should not be lost on voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update:  Just to clarify my position, to say that we won long ago does not mean to say that we couldn't still lose that win under certain circumstances.  For example, if we were to cut and run (withdraw all troops immediately) the progress we have made in Iraq could be undone and the effort could result in what would constitute a loss.  The following analogy might not be the best, but it is what immediately comes to mind.  Let's say Teams A and B are playing basketball.  With two minutes to go in the game, Team A leads Team B by 40 points.  Team A has effectively won the game.  There could still be points scored by Team B, and Team A could still even suffer some injuries, but barring anything exceptional happening, the game has been won.  But what if, with two minutes to go, Team A decided to send all their players home.  Team A would lose by forfeiting the game.  That is what I fear could happen in Iraq if Democrats had their way. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

         <title>The Jesse MacBeth Video</title>
         <link>http://feeds.wizbangblog.com/WizbangFullFeed?m=1279</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;Jesse MacBeth's lies about committing war atrocities as a Ranger in Iraq, while he was actually in and out of jail in Arizona, have his buddies on the left and in Iraq Veterans Against The War scrambling to disassociate themselves with MacBeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing they have tried to do was spike the video.  Well thanks to one of &lt;a href="http://hotair.com/archives/the-blog/2006/05/23/jesse-macbeth-video-goes-viral/"&gt;Hotair's &lt;/a&gt; readers there is now a link to a torrent of the video at &lt;a href="http://www.torrentspy.com/torrent/745169/Confessions_Of_An_Iraqi_War_Veteran"&gt;Torrentspy&lt;/a&gt;.  Since a lot of people don't want to be bothered, we've posted the video online, and unlike the YouTube version, we won't be taking it down...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

         <title>Possible Human-to-Human Transmission of Avian Flu in Indonesia</title>
         <link>http://feeds.wizbangblog.com/WizbangFullFeed?m=1277</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000080&amp;sid=aWESsJvt6CFE&amp;refer=asia"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, seven cases of Indonesian bird flu are connected to patients:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; May 23 (Bloomberg) -- All seven people infected with bird flu in a cluster of Indonesian cases can be linked to other patients, according to disease trackers investigating possible human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A team of international experts has been unable to find animals that might have infected the people, the World Health Organization said in a statement today. In one case, a 10-year- old boy who caught the virus from his aunt may have passed it to his father, the first time officials have seen evidence of a three-person chain of infection, an agency spokeswoman said. Six of the seven people have died.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Almost all of the 218 cases of H5N1 infections confirmed by the WHO since late 2003 can be traced to direct contact with sick or dead birds. Strong evidence of human-to-human transmission may prompt the global health agency to convene a panel of experts and consider raising the pandemic alert level, said Maria Cheng, an agency spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;``Considering the evidence and the size of the cluster, it's a possibility,'' Cheng said in a telephone interview. ``It depends on what we're dealing with in Indonesia. It's an evolving situation.''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 32-year-old father in the cluster of cases on the island of Sumatra was ``closely involved in caring for his son, and this contact is considered a possible source of infection,'' The WHO said in its statement. Three others, including the sole survivor in the group, spent a night in a ``small'' room with the boy's aunt, who later died and was buried before health officials could conduct tests for the H5N1 virus. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12939359/"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; has more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The WHO says there was probably an eighth case, a woman who died, but no tests were carried out.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Epidemiological evidence suggests that the woman was in fact the first case and that three family members spent at least one night in a small room with her at a time when she would have been coughing frequently, the WHO said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H5N1 has picked up speed this year, moving into parts of Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Bird flu remains primarily an avian disease.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the bird flu isn't expected to &lt;a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12933353/"&gt;come to the US for quite a while&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000080&sid=aWESsJvt6CFE&refer=asia">Bloomberg</a>, seven cases of Indonesian bird flu are connected to patients:</p>

<blockquote> May 23 (Bloomberg) -- All seven people infected with bird flu in a cluster of Indonesian cases can be linked to other patients, according to disease trackers investigating possible human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus.

         <title>New Osama Bin Laden Audio Tape</title>
         <link>http://feeds.wizbangblog.com/WizbangFullFeed?m=1276</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;In a new audio tape, Osama Bin Laden says America has it all wrong, that  Zacarias Moussaoui had nothing to do with 9/11: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyid=2006-05-23T205410Z_01_L23145974_RTRUKOC_0_US-ATTACK-MOUSSAOUI.xml&amp;src=rss&amp;rpc=22"&gt;DUBAI (Reuters)&lt;/a&gt; - Osama bin Laden said Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person convicted in a U.S. court for the September 11 attacks, had nothing to do with the operations, according to a Web site audiotape released on Tuesday.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Bin Laden said he had personally assigned tasks to the 19 hijackers who staged the attacks on U.S. cities which killed about 3,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The truth is that he has no connection whatsoever with the events of September 11. I am certain of what I say because I was responsible for entrusting the 19 brothers ... with the raids," said the speaker who sounded like the leader of Al Qaeda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authenticity of the tape could not be verified. It was posted on a Web site often used by Al Qaeda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moussaoui was sentenced on May 4 to life in prison with no chance of release, ending 4-1/2 years of legal wrangling over his fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 37-year-old French citizen of Moroccan descent pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy in connection with the attacks, in which hijacked airliners were flown into buildings in New York City and Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some U.S. officials initially said they believed Moussaoui was to have taken part in the September 11 attacks as a 20th hijacker. Others later said he was supposed to have been part of a second wave of attacks that were not carried out.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy McCarthy at &lt;a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OWFkMDc0OTU4MTYxMmZiODExMzhjOGY2MTM0MGEyODE="&gt;The Corner&lt;/a&gt; offers this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Anyone want to bet that the MSM won't run a round of stories suggesting that "this new revelation casts new doubt on the recent conviction of the only defendant prosecuted by the Bush Justice Department in connection with the suicide hijacking attacks ..."?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Didn't think so. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

         <title>The Fox visits the henhouse</title>
         <link>http://feeds.wizbangblog.com/WizbangFullFeed?m=1275</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, is visiting the United States. I have a few thoughts: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) When he goes home, can we give him a little gift to remember us by? Say, a few million of his citizens here illegally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B) Is he planning on going home, or overstaying his visa and staying illegally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;III) Could this be a tour to recruit lawyers for his planned lawsuits about the United States having the sheer gumption to consider enforcing our own borders?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d) If putting a wall on our side of the border is a gross violation of Mexico's sovereignty, how is Mexico's president coming to the United States and lobby our lawmakers not a violation of ours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;v) Is there any chance that when (or, rather, if) Fox leaves, we can make him fly over Mexico and then try to re-enter his homeland, undocumented, from the south and see just how his people handle the illegal immigration problem?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

         <title>The Essential President Bush</title>
         <link>http://feeds.wizbangblog.com/WizbangFullFeed?m=1273</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have not yet read &lt;a href="http://theanchoressonline.com/2006/05/22/the-essential-president-bush/"&gt;The Essential President Bush &lt;/a&gt;by &lt;a href="http://theanchoressonline.com"&gt;The Anchoress&lt;/a&gt;,  read it now.   It will remind even those that are not so happy with him right now, how much good this President has done, often in the face of unprecedented circumstances.  I am not suggesting anyone stop complaining about things they don't like about the President's positions on spending or immigration or any other issue.  I am just asking that they acknowledge the good, as well.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps I am a dim bulb, but President Bush has never surprised me, and that is probably why I have never felt let down or "betrayed" by him. He is, in essentials, precisely who he has ever been. He did not surprise me when he managed, in August of 2001, to find a morally workable solution in the matter of Embryonic Stem Cells. He did not surprise me when, a month later, he stood on a pile of rubble and lifted a broken city from its knees. When my NYFD friends told me of the enormous consolation and strength he brought to his meetings with grieving families, I was not surprised. When the World Series opened in New York City and the President was invited to throw the first pitch, there was no surprise in his throwing (while wearing body armor) a perfect strike....

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
...Let me tell you what has surprised me about George W. Bush. I have been surprised by his ability to keep from attacking-in-kind the "public servants" in Washington who - for five years - have not been able to speak of the American President with the respect he is due, by virtue of both his office and his humanity, because they are entralled with hate and owned by opportunism. I have been surprised that he has kept his committment to "changing the tone" even when it has long been clear that the only way the tone in Washington will ever change is if everyone named Bush or Clinton or Kennedy is cleared out and "career politicians" are shown the door and - it must be said - every university "School of Journalism" is converted to a daisy garden...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note:  I just updated my original post by adding the above quote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:  Some blogger friends of mine (chicks all) have started a site called &lt;a href="http://hangrightpolitics.com"&gt;Hang Right Politics&lt;/a&gt;.  This is their goal: "I hope we can discuss issues important to conservatives/republicans on this site without so much of the acrimony seen on some other sites. We want free debate but we won't tolerate profanity or name-calling...We will not bash our president or call him names on this site. This does not mean we will not disagree with him when we disagree, but we will attempt to do so in an objective manner."  I wish them the best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>You have to be pretty highly educated to be this dumb</title>
         <link>http://feeds.wizbangblog.com/WizbangFullFeed?m=1272</link>
         <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning's Boston Globe has an opinion column by H. D. S. Greenway that discusses the war in Iraq, and cites some rather remarkable historical parallels. Greenway puts together a thorough list of prior wars, ones started under false pretenses. Citing the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805078614/qid=1148382573/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-3040279-6084855?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155"&gt;new book&lt;/a&gt; of a historian who seems to have a rather leftist bent, Greenway talks about conflicts as long ago as 1893 where the war was arranged by the alleged "aggrieved" nation, and brings it up to 1954 and Israel's conflict with Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a shame Mr. Greenway seems to have a political version of Alzheimer's, where he can recall long-ago events with crystal clarity, but much more recent events escape him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two foundations of his argument are the Downing Street memo and the imminent threat of Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction. And both are very fragile reeds for him to hang his argument upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, the Downing Street memo. Its authenticity is still highly questionable, but for the sake of this argument I'll grant it's authentic. It simply doesn't say what people seem to want it to say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, their obsession with the term "fixed." The term has multiple meanings, and one must look at the context to determine what it means. In the Memo, it's pretty clear to me (and I like to think I have a pretty good mastery of the English language) that in this context, the meaning of "fixed" is "attached" or "focused," and not "rigged." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it says that the Bush administration was attached to the idea of removing Saddam. Big whoop. That was the official US government policy, as ratified by Congress and the President in 1998. The great revelation here? That the Bush Administration was continuing the policy authorized by the Clinton Administration, and endorsed by an Act Of Congress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the "paint a US plane in UN markings" bit, I have nothing to add beyond what &lt;a href="http://wizbangblog.com/2006/04/02/were-the-new-york-times-dont-tell-us-about-reality-we-live-in-our-own-world.php"&gt;I wrote over a month ago&lt;/a&gt;. Several commenters with far more experience than I (exactly zero) added quite a bit to the argument, but I stand by my original thoughts: if it was brought up at all, then it was done strictly to eliminate it as a possibility and point out its grotesque stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as Greenway's second point, the "imminent WMD threat" element. This one is one I used to enjoy going after, but I'm starting to burn out on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I challenge anyone -- anyone -- to actually go back into official records, statements, transcripts, or other documents and show ONE INSTANCE where Bush or any high-ranking member of his administration actually SAID that Saddam posed an imminent threat to the United States, or conclusively possessed WMDs. I was watching the news closely at the time, and they way I recall it, they repeatedly stressed that Saddam was a MOUNTING threat, but NOT imminent -- the whole idea was to stop him once it was clear that he wanted to pose such a threat, but before he could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was, to me, a sound policy: we've spent way too much of our history of waiting and hoping for threats to diminish on their own, and then paying the butcher's bill when we couldn't avoid the conflict. Saddam clearly wanted WMDs and to attack the US, and was taking strides towards being able to do just that; had the Bush administration simply waited until he did attack, then there would be loud cries of condemnation for him not stopping Saddam when it could have been done much more easily -- and I would have been one of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as far as Saddam's WMDs -- we never said he had them, but that he hadn't proven that he didn't. If he was bluffing, hoping to tap-dance around and say he didn't, but hinting that he might, demanding that we simply trust him, that was as good as finding a bunch of nukes, a couple hundred vials of Ebola, and mountains of Sarin shells. I hate to keep repeating myself, but this is such a non-starter -- I took it apart &lt;a href="http://wizbangblog.com/2005/02/01/bush-lied-people-died-a-look-at-iraq-and-the-wmd-issue.php"&gt;over a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, and even then I only did it because I was sick of the intellectual dishonesty behind it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really, really hate to use the old saying about how if you repeat a lie often enough, eventually people will believe it's true -- but that seems to be the only rational explanation for Greenway's piece in the Globe. The only question is whether he's so stupid he's bought into the lies, or is he deliberately trying to perpetuate it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(For the record: I wrote this early this morning, long before Lorie posted this piece. I did NOT crib from her, nor did she crib from me -- just an odd coincidence, or perhaps evidence of how pervasive the false meme is becoming.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: a few weeks ago, &lt;a href="http://wizbangblog.com/2006/05/12/i-yam-what-i-yam.php"&gt;I busted a critic of mine&lt;/a&gt; for sock-puppetry (posting critical, mutually supporting comments under different names). At the time, I said I did not care for it and would expose it when it happens. In that spirit, I have to disclose that "John Kerry," "Bill Clinton," "Harry Reid," "Al Gore," "Ted Kennedy", and "Jay Rockefeller" are all posting from the same IP, and it is NOT one that traces back to the US Senate. In fact, it actually corresponds with another regular commenter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I busted "viet vet," another regular detractor, "lee," said that he suspected some of Wizbang's regular supporters might also be sock puppets. I asked him to pass along names, and I would investigate. &lt;a href="http://wizbangblog.com/2006/05/12/i-yam-what-i-yam.php#214301"&gt;He accepted&lt;/a&gt; that offer, but has yet to send me a single name. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
