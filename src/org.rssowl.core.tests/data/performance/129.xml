<title>Movie Review: &lt;i&gt;Volver&lt;/i&gt;</title>
<link>http://feeds.blogcritics.org/bc/articles?m=1240</link>
<author>Matt Riviera</author><description>&lt;p&gt;It's easy to see why &lt;i&gt;Volver&lt;/i&gt; is generating buzz as part of the Official Selection in Cannes this year. Almodóvar has turned in a fascinating family portrait full of colourful characters, engaging drama and moving revelations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title indicates, this is a story about returning to one's roots. After her death, a mother (Carmen Maura) follows her offsprings from her hometown to Madrid in order to fix the situations she couldn't resolve during her life. Her ghost slowly becomes a comfort to one of her daughters (Lola Dueñas) and grandchild (Yohana Cobo). Meanwhile her second headstrong daughter Raimunda (Penelope Cruz) is having to deal with the sudden murder of her husband. Unaware of her mother's return, she finds herself stuggling to cope with the cards she has been dealt, relying on the kindness of neighbours and strangers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incest, abuse, poverty and death are some of dark themes running through the story, but it's the healing power of motherhood and family ties which eventually shines through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Volver&lt;/i&gt; is a homecoming of sorts for both the director, who shot the film in his childhood home of La Mancha, and for actresses Carmen Maura and Penelope Cruz. The former hadn't worked with the Spanish filmmaker since being his muse in the 80's. The latter's last collaboration with Almodóvar dates back to 1999. In between, Cruz has been seen in a series of bad Hollywood films and tabloid photo spreads. Returning to Spain has proved an excellent career move: her performance in &lt;i&gt;Volver&lt;/i&gt; is luminous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an actress, it's incredibly difficult to outshine the cast in an Almodóvar picture, especially one where men are absent and women are godesses. As Raimunda, Cruz seems to be literally lit from within, bathing the characters she comes in touch with in her warmth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Volver&lt;/i&gt; is filled to the brim with beautifully constructed scenes of rich dramatic intensity, acted out on a lush backdrop of colourful, inventive set design. As usual, the score by Alberto Iglesisas adds discreet layers of texture to the story, building to a musical and emotional climax, here taking the form of a classic number by Flamenco queen Estrella Morente.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What impresses me most with Almodóvar is the peerless writing, which manages to be clever and infused with a generous humanity all at the same time. Like &lt;i&gt;&lt;Bad Education&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;All About My Mother&lt;/i&gt; before it, &lt;i&gt;Volver&lt;/i&gt; is a densely-plotted film full of twists and turns, mixing elements of thriller, melodrama and comedy, yet managing to land rather elegantly on its feet by the time the credits roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="authorbio"&gt;Matt Riviera suffers from terminal wanderlust, a penchant for daydreaming and the tendency to function under the mistaken assumption that reality can rarely compete with fiction. &lt;/div&gt;

<title>Movie Review: &lt;i&gt;Crash&lt;/i&gt;</title>
<link>http://feeds.blogcritics.org/bc/articles?m=1241</link>
<author>Casey Lunkley</author><description>&lt;p&gt;"Crash" is a complex movie with a simple premise: set in Los Angeles it follows eight main characters (and many, many more supporting) from all walks of life and races whose lives intersect at some point during one 24 hour period. These people are all different yet all alienated, to the point of breaking, so much so that when they come together, things explode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexity of the film comes from the encounters between characters and their tangled lives and worlds. Paul Haggis' screenplay is so intricate and delicately written I couldn't begin to try to summarize the actual plot line (which destines this article to be kind of vague), but everyone meets everyone else at some point in the film (and there are a whole lot of characters). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, these meetings are variably intense, casual, fleeting, and dangerous, but they all effect the participants in profound and provocative ways, causing lives to find enlightenment or swerve violently, and watching it all unfold is mesmerizing because Haggis (Oscar Nominated writer of Million Dollar Baby) made the film meaty with messy characters and topics and stories to chew and hurtle along with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The all-encompassing theme of the film is racism, and it is dealt with bluntly, honestly, and without reservation. Every single character participates in the perpetuation of the ugly cycle but also suffers because of it. Where racism makes for an interesting enough subject for an already provoking and fairly experimental film (I was surprised to see this get wide release), it's only the catalyst for a deeper, resounding story of redemption and the universality of our lonely situation which the movie becomes during its second hour (what you could call Act II). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It switches from a somewhat depressing contemplative amalgamation of moments about racism in everyday life and how destructive it is, to a throbbing, intense web of choices and consequences -- life and death, vivifying or soul killing -- and the chance at redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following their actions in Act I, everyone meets a fork in the road or is given a second chance of some sort. Some take it, some don't, but regardless, by the end of the movie everyone has changed. This is what gives the movie wings during its second hour, makes it interesting, keeps you guessing and on knife's-edge. It also gives the characters depth and soul and shows that despite perceived and upheld differences, when it comes down to it we aren't different (which we see in a shattering scene between the characters played by Ryan Philippe and Larenz Tate after Tate notices that he and Philippe have the same St. Christopher statue), in fact we desperately need each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's one of the few films I've seen where everyone is at fault somehow and yet there are no villains. It gives hope, particularly with something as ugly as racism: everyone is fallible, but everyone has the capacity for good and nobility. That said, each of these character's inner struggles makes for all the conflict and resolution you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A talented ensemble drives the film, sharing almost equal amounts of screen time, but the folks who really stood out and had my full attention each time were Terrence Howard (plays a TV director), Matt Dillon (as a patrol cop), Sandra Bullock (a rich housewife), Don Cheadle (a detective), and Michael Peña (a locksmith). These five gave deeply, deeply felt performances portraying a wide range of emotions and personal situations, giving souls -- alone, yearning, and searching in a world that doesn't seem to care -- to shells of imperfect people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the actors triumph in little moments of human contact: a glance, an embrace, a pause, a smile, a wince, things that breathe life into the film and with simple visuals give it profundity. This is beautifully illustrated in a small scene between the downward spiraling Jean (Sandra Bullock) and her maid after she's begun to realize all her problems may not be about the two black guys who car jacked her, but her own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some closing notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times the dialogue and acting can be stilted and unnatural; some of the initial "racial" situations seem forced; certain scenes could have used some editing or fine tuning, but by the end I didn't care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also may be helpful to know that the first hour spends its time setting everything up for Act II, although it will seem more like a photo essay on racism than a setup. But by the time Act I ends you're ready for something substantial to happen, and at the perfect moment, stuff happens. I was entirely satisfied with this movie, I couldn't have asked for anything more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still it's impressive, with his debut Haggis made a film that magically maintains a storytelling balancing act about people's lives that almost seamlessly flows, takes an honest look at racism with an understanding of mankind, a belief in redemption, and even hope. As I walked out of the theater into the rainy night it resonated with me and colored my thoughts as I made my way through the crowds of unknown fellow people filling the cinema. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's about all I can ask for in a film. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="authorbio"&gt;Casey is a blogger from New York, NY who's interested in a wide array from subjects, from music, movies, politics, the Supreme Court, and more.&lt;/div&gt;

<title>TV Preview: &lt;i&gt;Lost&lt;/i&gt; Finale</title>
<link>http://feeds.blogcritics.org/bc/articles?m=1242</link>
<author>Erin McMaster</author><description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight brings the two hour season finale of &lt;i&gt;Lost&lt;/i&gt;. And this season's finale is said to be more powerful than last year's. So powerful that &lt;i&gt;Lost&lt;/i&gt; creator JJ Abrams said his co-creator, Damon Lindelof, made an ending that surprised even him. I think that means that tonight will give us with two hours of intense viewing pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is habit with &lt;i&gt;Lost&lt;/i&gt;, when a question is answered, about 20 more pop up. We know there is a connection between the passengers as their flashbacks have hinted towards this. Will the finale bring us closer to discovering this connection or simply make us wonder even more? And will we finally get the truth on who The Others are, or just more teasers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael has asked five of his "friends" to help him get Walt back. Sayid knows it is a scam and makes a plan with Jack to thwart it. Don't believe me? Then check out the &lt;a href=http://us.video.aol.com/video.index.adp?mode=2&amp;pmmsid=1652621&amp;ncid=aoletv00050000000001&gt;preview clip&lt;/a&gt; from AOL TV. And even though Michael is adamant about getting Walt back &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; way, it seems Kate has her suspicions too. Take a look at another &lt;a href=http://us.video.aol.com/video.index.adp?mode=2&amp;pmmsid=1652622&amp;ncid=aoletv0005000000001&gt;preview clip&lt;/a&gt; as they set off to confront The Others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finale, "Live Together, Die Alone," airs tonight, May 24, 2006 at 9/8 C. &lt;br/&gt;

<title>Concert Review: John Hiatt - Humphrey's By The Bay, Shelter Island</title>
<link>http://feeds.blogcritics.org/bc/articles?m=1237</link>
<author>Allan Karl</author><description>&lt;p&gt;It was an idyllic southern California night complete with a burning orange and red sunset, gentle breeze swaying postcard palm trees and John Hiatt with North Mississippi Allstars (NMAS) tearing up the stage at Humphrey's By The Bay in San Diego. Toward the end of his 90-minute set Hiatt said "the weathermen said it was going to rain...I guess they were wrong like they always are," before ripping into his rocking set closing number "The Tiki Bar Is Open" where the synergy of Hiatt's 30+ years performing experience combined with the youthful energy of NMAS driving rhythm section brought the crowd to their feet. It's summertime in SoCal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain actually came the night before clearing the air and washing away any doubt of bad weather reinforcing once more that Humphrey's By The Sea is perhaps the quintessential intimate California outdoor live music venue. And judging by &lt;a href="http://www.johnhiatt.com/"&gt;Hiatt's&lt;/a&gt; perpetual smile and ubiquitous dose of facial expressions and grimaces, he was there not only to entertain the almost sold-out crowd but to have serious fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, this is not the first Hiatt show I've attended. A couple years ago he did an interesting &lt;a href="http://www.johnhiatt.com/Hilburn.html"&gt;mini-tour&lt;/a&gt; with peer singer-songwriter guitarists Joe Ely, Guy Clark, and Lyle Lovett. And just before recording his latest release, Master of Disaster, he &lt;a href="http://www.blog.digitaltavern.com/2004/03/16/john-hiatt-solo-acoustic-coach-house-san-juan-capistrano-california/"&gt;performed a solo acoustic show&lt;/a&gt; where he tested some songs off the new album at the venerable Coach House in San Juan Capistrano.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.humphreysconcerts.com/"&gt;Humphrey's By The Bay&lt;/a&gt; on San Diego's Shelter Island is a waterfront hotel, gourmet restaurant, and outdoor theatre. In the early 80's it started what was then a summer smooth jazz concert series.  Besides Hiatt, the 1300-seat outdoor theater, now in its 25th year and thanks to California's endless summer, sees more than 80 nights of music and comedy this year including  Boz Scaggs, Lyle Lovett, India Arie, Blues Traveler, Queensryche, and Emmy Lou Harris -- a wonderfully diverse and more interesting lineup than the smooth jazz Humprey's started with years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight's show opened up with a short electric set by the &lt;a href="http://www.nmallstars.com/" target="_blank"&gt;North Mississippi Allstars&lt;/a&gt;, Hiatt's supporting band featuring Luther and Cody Dickinson on guitar and drums and Chris Chew on bass. The Dickinson brothers are sons of legendary Memphis record producer &lt;a href="http://www.zebraranch.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jim Dickinson&lt;/a&gt;. Ironic enough, the elder Dickinson produced Hiatt's 21st album, &lt;em&gt;Master of Disaster&lt;/em&gt;, which this tour is featuring and promoting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.digitaltavern.com/images/luther_nmas.jpg" hspace="4" vspace="4"&gt; &lt;img src="http://blog.digitaltavern.com/images/chew_nmas.jpg" hspace="4" vspace="4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was unfamiliar with the three-time nominated North Mississippi Allstars prior to attending this concert and based on reports from other dates on Hiatt's tour I expected an acoustic bluesy rock set from the up and coming NMAS. Instead, the youthful band delivered a mix of rhythm and blues and rock providing the perfect soundtrack to the setting sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set featured drummer Cody Dickinson playing his funky washboard to the driving beat of Chew's bass and brother Luther and helper on drums -- the most unique washboard solo I've ever heard. Luther Dickinson's slide guitar work was also a surprise but his vocals were lost in the mix and lacked punch and soul -- perhaps he's shy and not comfortable fronting the larger venue. And his lack of audience eye contact wasn't helped by the flap of hair hanging in his face. But judging from the sound and audience reaction this band is one to watch as they grow together.  I'm sure several months on the road with legend and performing mentor John Hiatt will help blend confidence and experience making for a tasty future for the Hernando, Mississippi trio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commanding the stage after a short 15-minute intermission, Hiatt delivered the goods throughout a 16 song set that blended songs from his latest release with a handful of amped-up versions of Hiatt classics proving the 54-year old performer not only still has the song-writing chops, but has the guts and energy to inject new life into his timeless songs. And keeping them timely is something Hiatt does best. During a rock n' roll driving version of "Memphis In The Meantime" from his 1987 release &lt;em&gt;Bring on the Family&lt;/em&gt; Hiatt brought the lyrics current by replacing Ronnie Milsap with &lt;a href="http://www.bradpaisley.com/"&gt;Brad Paisley&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not &amp;#8216;till hell freezes over, maybe you can wait that long,
But I don&amp;#8217;t think Brad Paisley's ever gonna record this song&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, sitting in the restaurant prior to the show I shared a taste of wine with the folks at the table next to me and the conversation quickly turned to John Hiatt. "When I told people I was going to see John Hiatt tonight, they all said 'Who?'", the gentleman in his early 40's said to me.  And perhaps that's the good thing about John Hiatt. Though many may not know him by name, more people know his songs for Bonnie Raitt, Iggy Pop, Conway Twitty, Three Dog Night, B.B. King, Bob Dylan, Bonnie Raitt and Eric Clapton have all covered them. Looking around at the handful of empty seats on the grass at Humphrey's I'm amazed that tickets for Hiatt were still available as he began his set yet Queensryche is sold out for a show two months from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.digitaltavern.com/images/hiatt_humphreys06.1.jpg" width="250" hspace="4" vspace="4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.digitaltavern.com/images/hiatt_humphreys06.2.jpg" hspace="4" vspace="4"&gt; &lt;img src="http://blog.digitaltavern.com/images/hiatt_humphreys06.3.jpg" hspace="4" vspace="4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiatt rock n' roll opener, the title track from his early 90's release &lt;em&gt;Perfectly Good Guitar&lt;/em&gt; and driven by Luther Dickinson's masterful slide guitar work, set the tone for the rest of the concert: this wasn't going to be acoustic folk show playing homage to roots music. Instead, the band launched into driving versions of Buffalo River Home" and "Your Dad Did" and then metamorphosing the normally folkie "Howlin' Down The Cumberland" into a rocking blues anthem. And taking the lyrics up a notch Hiatt jumped into his own take on &lt;i&gt;Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt; controversy lamenting the destiny and whereabouts of love and affection in "Love's Not Where We Thought We Left It:"&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The apostles were jealous&lt;br/&gt;
Of Mary Magdalene and Jesus&lt;br/&gt;
Said why do you love her more than us&lt;br/&gt;
Jesus turned back in disgust&lt;br/&gt;
Said why do I love her more than you&lt;br/&gt;
The answer is a question&lt;br/&gt;
Just ask yourself what can I do&lt;br/&gt;
To gain my lord's affection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love's not where you thought you left it&lt;br/&gt;
Who took the last of love and kept it&lt;br/&gt;
Caged love in tried to protect it&lt;br/&gt;
Love's not where we thought we left it&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the crowd raising Tiki Bar, Hiatt returned to the stage sans NMAS to sing the soulful "Have A Little Faith" solo on the piano then brought the crowd back to their feet and singing along to "Slow Turning", perhaps his only top 10 hit in his more than 30 year musical career. So while Hiatt may not sit in the mainstream, his music, songwriting, performance combined with the amazing talent he surrounds himself with means he'll always have an audience in me and the other several hundred friends that joined me last night for a California night of rock n' roll and good wine.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, Bob Dylan's 65 today</title>
<link>http://feeds.blogcritics.org/bc/articles?m=1238</link>
<author>Nik Dirga</author><description>&lt;p&gt;Happy 65th today to the free-wheeling Bob Dylan! Hard to believe, the same age as my Dad. I've coincidentally been on a Dylan kick lately, reading the entertaining primer, &lt;em&gt;The Rough Guide To Bob Dylan,&lt;/em&gt; and recently finally upped my street cred by purchasing &lt;em&gt; Highway 61 Revisited&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt; Blonde on Blonde.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once read somewhere (wish I could remember where) something to the effect that, when you're a kid, you discover and love The Beatles; as a teenager, Led Zeppelin; a college kid, The Doors; and then as an adult with kids of your own, you finally grow into Bob Dylan. Perhaps that's true, because I've found new depth in the man in recent years. I've always admired Dylan and owned all three of his greatest hits collections as well as scattered CDs, but I never quite ascended into Dylan fanatic status. But I've grown fond of his finest works, such as the terrific, heartbroken epic &lt;em&gt;Blood On The Tracks,&lt;/em&gt; which I bought a few years back and listen to regularly. (If there's a better, more truthful and vicious song about the bitter bile of a breakup than "Idiot Wind," I haven't heard it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've only seen Dylan once live, and it was back in 1990 when I was a college freshman barely familiar with him. He was playing part of his "Never Ending Tour" and came to my school, the University of Mississippi. It was the hip show to go to, and everyone knew about his song "Oxford Town," which dissected the college's darkest hour (the racist uproar and violence over the admission of the college's first black student James Meredith in 1962). It was kind of funny - "let's go see the show by this guy who wrote a song about how racist and awful we were back then" - but you know, you're a freshman in college, tickets were cheap. Dylan is reportedly either awesome or godawful live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the awful, with lots of jibba-jabba incomprehensible muttering-singing by Dylan that obscured his great lyrics. (Didn't realize he was playing "Oxford Town" until halfway through the song.) Thanks to the miracles of the obsessional Dylanologists on the internet I'm even able to find the &lt;a href="http://www.bjorner.com/DSN11530%20-%201990%20US%20Fall%20Tour.htm#DSN11640"&gt;set list&lt;/a&gt; for that long-ago 1990 show - he played "Wiggle Wiggle"?? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was a little young to "get" Dylan then, but as one of the man's songs goes, "Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now." Happy birthday, Mr. Dylan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="authorbio"&gt;An editor at a daily newspaper in Southern Oregon, Nik Dirga writes whenever the mood strikes him about books, music, movies, pop culture and more. He and his wife and 2-year-old son are moving to New Zealand this fall. &lt;/div&gt;

<title>Book Review &lt;i&gt; The Right Words At The Right Time Volume 2: Your Turn!&lt;/i&gt;, by Marlo Thomas And new Friends</title>
<link>http://feeds.blogcritics.org/bc/articles?m=1239</link>
<author>NancyGail</author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Right Words At The Right Time Volume 2: Your turn!&lt;/i&gt; by Marlo Thomas and new Friends, is the second book in a series about people who heard the right words at the point when they were needed most. While subjects of the first book were well-known folk, this book contains stories of regular people just like you and me. Proceeds go to help St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, which is working to find a cure for childhood cancer. Thomas is the national outreach director. When her father, Danny Thomas, passed away, she took over administrative duties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into 13 sections. In each, after reading the many heartwarming tales, you will be introduced to one of the children being treated at St. Jude.  A few stories are particularly poignant, among them those that took me back to September 11, 2001, the day the World Trade Center towers were destroyed. Those who lost relatives that day told of how kindness impacted them deeply. In "A Message in a Teddy Bear" by Daniel Walisiak, the pain of his fiancee's death was eased by a note attached to a stuffed animal. All relatives of the dead were encouraged to take an animal from Ground Zero, but the bear went with Daniel. He was later able to visit the young girl who wrote the note and her schoolmates, which showed him life can go on after tragedy.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a change of tone, readers will laugh out loud at "A Hitchhiker's Tale", by Robert J. Simmons, about a young teenage boy who is trying hard not to fit in. His father is a local high school teacher and coach in their small town. This makes it very difficult to find himself without scrutiny from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like &lt;i&gt;Chicken Soup for the Soul&lt;/i&gt;, this book is not meant to be read in one sitting. It's nice to pick it up and read for a break in your busy day. The stories will stay with you after the covers are closed.&lt;br/&gt;

<title>Book Review &lt;i&gt; The Legacy of Carpocrates&lt;/i&gt;, by Osman Khareef</title>
<link>http://feeds.blogcritics.org/bc/articles?m=1234</link>
<author>NancyGail</author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; The Legacy of Carpocrates&lt;/i&gt;, by Osman Khareef, is along the same lines of &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt; which drew my immediate attention.  At the heart of this book lies a quest for power between the Catholic Church and a faction called the Priory Arcadia. Although there are references to real people, such as Joseph Murphy, the story is pure fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priory Arcadia, according to the author, now deceased, wants to prove its authenticity by tracing its lineage back through the bloodline of Jesus. With the help of JeanLuc Kuovic, the group gets hold of icons that appear to depict the family of Jesus. This is the easy part. The tougher part comes when they try to keep the icons a secret until all the senior members can come together for the "Fulfilment", set to take place in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Told from the viewpoint of someone not born in this country, this book takes on religion, world powers, blackmail, espionage, sex, and greed. And yes, a warning is on the very first page so people know what they are getting into. The characters are not quite who they seem to be, and the revelations at the end will take readers by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, this book is not for sensitive folks. While it is obviously fiction, some of the claims are a little hard to grasp.  For example, the reason for the conflict of power has much to do with the tenets of religious faith. One would be wise to remember this book is fiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the denouement is comparable to Malachi at the end of the Old Testament opening the door to the New Testament. All the events lead up to a new beginning for Priory Arcadia, but the past and present preparations have to fade away. The means of accomplishing this will stay with readers well beyond the time when the book is closed.   &lt;br/&gt;

<title>Pentagon Releases Flight 77 videos-Conspiracy Theorists Give Up-Only Not</title>
<link>http://feeds.blogcritics.org/bc/articles?m=1235</link>
<author>Casey Lunkley</author><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Pentagon released video footage of American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, because of a lawsuit filed by a not-for-profit watchdog organization named Judicial Watch. The Pentagon released it amid hopes from both federal officials and Judicial Watch that conspiracy theorists could finally be at ease with the new footage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those hopes didn't come true. Not only are conspiracy theorists among message boards and chat rooms across the internet still holding onto beliefs that the government not only knew, but planned, the September 11 attacks, they're making up new ones that coincide with the &lt;a href="http://judicialwatch.org/flight77.shtml"&gt;new video&lt;/a&gt;.  They say a plane the size of Flight 77 could no way look as small as it did in the video, and it must have been a missile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No amount of reasoning with conspiracy theorists will ever get them to stop. When you point out how disgraceful it is to the victims of 9/11, they say that you should "stop being a sheeple" and question everything the government tells you. When you ask where a missile could possibly be seen in the video, they remain silent or come at you with some link from "9/11 Truth". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conspiracy theorists aren't only disgracing victims of 9/11, they're also making the people they usually align themselves with, namely liberals, look bad. I'm not exactly sure what makes them distrust the government so badly to insinuate that the government kills completely innocent people just to go to war with a country or obtain oil, but I'm tired of it. If Donald Rumsfeld himself came out and told the country that the government had planned it, conspiracy theorists wouldn't be satisfied. They would question why he was telling us, and then come up with new theories as to why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here's my plea. Cut it out, conspiracy theorists. Pretty please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="authorbio"&gt;Casey is a blogger from New York, NY who's interested in a wide array from subjects, from music, movies, politics, the Supreme Court, and more.&lt;/div&gt;

<title>FA Premiership Merchandise: Saving Lives, One Fan at a Time</title>
<link>http://feeds.blogcritics.org/bc/articles?m=1236</link>
<author>Flash Warner</author><description>&lt;p&gt;It is often said that &lt;a href="http://www.premierleague.com/fapl.rac?command=forwardOnly&amp;nextPage=homepage" target="_blank"&gt;the FA Premier League&lt;/a&gt; is the best in the world as a spectacle for pace and goals. It is also said that it is the best league to watch if you're looking for a 38-game schedule that will raise the incidence of depression and alcoholism in your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Actually, don't take that seriously. My liver and I are the only ones saying that.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal problems notwithstanding, it comes as a surprise that the EPL has recently become the best league in the world to be a fan of if you find yourself in a life-threatening situation due to your own stupidity. I present the following as proof:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.flickr.com/56/152490212_b06a9b16ef_o.jpg" align="right"&gt; Case 1: A couple days before Arsenal FC went down in a 10-man flame to Barcelona in the Champions League final, &lt;a href="http://www.sunderlandtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=1107&amp;ArticleID=1501440" target="_blank"&gt; a 10-year-old English boy tried to climb his neighbor's fence&lt;/a&gt; in order to scope out the new trampoline sitting in the backyard. Apparently the sight was a bit too much to behold and in his excitement, the kid lost his footing and got impaled on a metal spiking a top the fence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though his chest wound was fairly substantial (three inches), the spike missed all vital organs. Now this happens to most people and they think that God intervened or there was a guardian angel or maybe they're just the luckiest tosser around. But not these people. This kid owes his life to the modern day chain mail known as the Commemorative 2005/2006 Arsenal Home Strip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, my thoughts exactly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the magical shirt saved the boy from certain doom by cushioning the spike's impact. Had it been cotton instead of Nike DriFit, the shirt would have ripped, thus allowing the metal to plunge deeper into the boy's chest. It would have been curtains for the young fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A young life being saved is heartwarming and all but can you see the headlines NEXT week? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;"10 Year Old Tries to Stop Bullet with Magical Arsenal Kit, Dies." &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation will end in nothing but trouble... messy trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Grain of salt warning: &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006230548,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;Article from The Sun&lt;/a&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case 2: Our other fantastic EPL life-saving tale takes us to the mountains of strife-torn Yemen where an Englishman named Tony found himself in the weeds while helping the Yemeni government set up a free-trade zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Yemen trades with others? This was news to me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at a roadblock with his bodyguard, Tony's car was ambushed by tribesmen wielding AK-47s who, according to Tony, "descended upon me like a pack of wolves." Having never been jumped by a pack of wolves, I don't know if this is a right comparison to his situation but were I in his shoes, I probably would have said something ridiculous like "they swooped down on me like crazed buzzards," so I'll let that go. In any case, the bad guys went into mating peacock mode and started waving their guns around and squawking about in a language no one could understand.  I often wonder why these lunatics don't learn a few English phrases so they can communicate their death threats in an efficient manner but in this case, it wasn't necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In my limited Arabic, I understood that they wanted to use me as a hostage to extract money from the EU and if I refused would kill me." [Limited Arabic, my arse. Limited Arabic is "I heard them say water and to die," not all of that!] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.flickr.com/50/152500918_a0915129de_o.png" align="right"&gt; Anyway, Tony and his bodyguard were dragged to the back of his car where the bandits noticed a Portsmouth FC club badge. Since the badge uses the crescent moon and star, both symbols of Islam, the hostiles assumed Tony was a practicing Muslim, put him back in his car, and told him to hit the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huzzah for Tony and his useless bodyguard, but what's he going to do when he's attacked by bandits that can read English? "Oh, uh, well, uh, by posing as a fan of, uh, the worst team in England, I'm actually helping Muslims against the West. Let me go?" Nice try, Tony. His good Samaritan ruse is going to wind up in a messier situation than the day the above-mentioned Arsenal fan realizes his kit isn't magic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as it stands, Arsenal kits prevent impaling and Pompey stickers stop roadblock attacks. Tune in next week when a man uses a Chelsea-sanctioned football to foil an assassination plot like he's Jack Bauer. In the meantime, you might want to pick up some other EPL squad merchandise. With all the metal fences and terrorists out there, one never knows when a life-threatening pickle could arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="authorbio"&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.flickr.com/45/152673932_3727b04a5c_t.jpg" align="left"&gt; Flash Warner spends her day as a speed and conditioning coach for a random university, which affords her with many hours of free time to make shallow, fairly obvious observations on life and sport.&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Blogcritics Editors' Picks: May 17 through May 23</title>
<link>http://feeds.blogcritics.org/bc/articles?m=1232</link>
<author>Lisa McKay</author><description>&lt;p&gt;The music writers are busy examining the roots of R&amp;B and rock and roll, the folks in the books section are busy examing the craft of writing, and the politics writers are busy examining just about everything. In between, you'll find movie reviews, space news, and sports and gaming news too. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Let me remind those of you who are chosen that you are invited to submit your own pick for next week (due to space considerations, please limit it to one). Please feel free to &lt;a href="mailto:distorted.angel@gmail.com"&gt;&lt;b&gt;email me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; your picks (including the URL) by next Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;MUSIC&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Music Editor Connie Phillips:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/18/080518.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;CD/DVD Review: &lt;i&gt;The Best of Chris Isaak&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nik Dirga&lt;/b&gt; takes a good look at an old favorite. He examines both the CD and DVD not only for its contents, but also compares it to current music trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week the &lt;b&gt;Modern Pea Pod&lt;/b&gt; has been treating us to a series of reviews from the &lt;i&gt;Stax Profiles&lt;/i&gt; series.  Two stand-out articles were &lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/18/075154.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;CD Review: Little Milton - &lt;i&gt;Stax Profiles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (written by &lt;b&gt;Laura Misjak&lt;/b&gt;) and &lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/21/084157.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;CD Review: Booker T. &amp; The M.G.'s - &lt;i&gt;Stax Profiles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (written by &lt;b&gt;Jon Cameron&lt;/b&gt;).  Both were provocative reviews that examined the roots of modern R&amp;B. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, &lt;b&gt;Jackie&lt;/b&gt;, for &lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/21/181724.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DVD Review: &lt;i&gt;Chuck Berry's Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and for sharing the personal memories that made you a fan as well as your thoughts on the DVD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;BOOKS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Books Editor Natalie Bennett:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogcritics has a sub-category for articles in books called &lt;a href="http://feeds.blogcritics.org/bc/books_writing"&gt;the writing life&lt;/a&gt;. As you'd expect on a site chock-full of writers keen to analyse and improve their craft, it is one of our most popular. This week, two Blogcritics looked at writing from different, equally illuminating, angles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Richard Marcus&lt;/b&gt;, in &lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/21/174446.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;When Writing Is Art&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, debated the old issue about writing reviews: are they good for the writer, or a dangerously wearying dead-end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a practical approach, &lt;b&gt;Mark Schannon&lt;/b&gt; introduced &lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/20/144121.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fifty Writing Tools from Poynter Online&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There's one key message, he says: "Every word counts." I'll stop now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Editor Gordon Hauptfleisch:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Richard Marcus&lt;/b&gt;, in his expressive and cohesive review of the fascinating &lt;a href = "http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/15/093949.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Broadcasting The Blues: Black Music In The Segregation Era&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, outlines the field research and rich musical history of the Blues, from its beginnings in the methods of field workers who would "scatter the good seeds on the land -- a technique which was called broadcasting," to its roundabout transmission to 1960s British Invasion groups who re-ignited American passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;TV/FILM&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Film Editor Erin McMaster:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;El Bicho's&lt;/b&gt; review of &lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/20/045628.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exploring The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an informative read about a DVD that very well may be trying to cash in on the popularity of &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lucas McNelly&lt;/b&gt; takes on &lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/18/154551.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Shop Around The Corner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and gives us a refreshing look at a classic film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Natalie Davis&lt;/b&gt; beautifully explains why I am addicted to &lt;a href=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/18/162259.php&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;American Idol&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and why Taylor Hicks will get my vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/22/054409.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a cheesy, yet charming film and &lt;b&gt;Christopher Soden&lt;/b&gt; tells us why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Casey Lunkley&lt;/b&gt; provides a heavenly glimpse at &lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/19/184229.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heavenly Creatures&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It makes me realize how badly I need to add this movie to my collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Editor Gordon Hauptfleisch:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;b&gt;Aaron Fleming's&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href = "http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/20/042757.php"&gt;DVD review of &lt;i&gt;In Hell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we almost get lost in Jean-Claude Van Damme's eyes. Literally: "A microcosm of being lies in those vortexes, and often it stands up and walks around the cornea, sometimes even going to the vestigial eyelid to pick up a paper." We're hoping it's Variety announcing, "Van Dammes' Flix Tix Kix Ass." We never thought we cared, until Fleming's dazzling use of language brought us to our senses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CULTURE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Culture Editor Diana Hartman:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With summer right around the corner, outdoor get-togethers aren't far behind. We may lack the social circle we think is necessary to kindle a successful party in the round. Fortunately, &lt;b&gt;Brian Sorrell's&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/18/061121.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;BBQ Tuesday: A Social Revolution In Your Own Backyard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is just the inspiration needed to foster a season full of good times, good friends, and good memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;POLITICS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Politics Editors Dave Nalle and Mark Schannon:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/20/142854.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suffering For the Actions of a Few&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;b&gt;Mark Edward Manning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Well-argued, cogent analysis of the animal rights movement's excesses as well as society's attitudes towards animal experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/20/142221.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fred Phelps Can **** My ****&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;b&gt;Mark Edward Manning&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;
Terrific and well-written attack on one of the most vile, distorted minds on the far right - from a conservative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/21/195004.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bush Guts Critical Science Projects And Outsources NASA Projects To India To Further His Ambitions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;b&gt;Jet in Columbus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Detailed analysis of both the scientific loss and the political dangers of Bush's single-minded space agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/23/130112.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Borderline Immigration Policy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;b&gt;Chancelucky&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Powerful satirical review of the twisting and turning going on trying to figure out a solution to illegal immigration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/18/220336.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Bush Administration and Iranian Anger&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;b&gt;Uncle Sammy Says&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Excellent analysis of the current situation in Iran backed up by the historical evidence that explains why America's image is so tarnished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/14/095305.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;NSA Data Gathering Leads to Lawsuits&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;b&gt;Dave Nalle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
As if the controversy around NSA collecting phone records wasn't enough, the plaintiff buzzards are circling which is sure to create more confusion (and wealth for the buzzards) than help us understand the legality of the administration's actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SPORTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Sports Editor Matthew T. Sussman:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/17/001937.php"&gt;Reds/Phillies: How I Ruined Jon Lieber's Perfect Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;M.D. Sandwasher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
If I published it 20 minutes earlier, it would have been an editor's pick last week. But I knew that the first article of this week's cycle of stories would be the first editor's pick as well. This is a classic tale of fan superstition when it comes to no-hitters and perfect games. Also, I just want to publicize the living tar out of this just to see if Jon Lieber himself reads it, so he knows who to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/18/085056.php"&gt;LeBron and the Cavs, Playing with House Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Craig Lyndall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The parallels of being a Cavaliers fan with sitting at the blackjack table pretty much held this together. Even though it was written at the peak of the team's success, it still rings true even after the Pistons came back to win. The house was dealt 21. Craps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/22/020205.php"&gt;Will Bonds Eventually Become a Designated Hitter?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Ryan Jerz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
He had me at the opening line: "Bear with me here. Let's play a game. Pretend, just while reading this, that Barry Bonds never did steroids." But with all the talk of his past, it's refreshing to see someone mention Barry Bonds' &lt;em&gt;future &lt;/em&gt;as a player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;GAMING&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Gaming Editor Ken Edwards:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/20/110251.php"&gt;Louisiana Passes Violent Video Game Law on Lies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;b&gt;Matt Paprocki&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The Parents Television Council and Louisiana politicians need to get some facts  straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/21/131429.php "&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nintendo DS Review: &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime - Hunters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;b&gt;Kevin Cortez&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A solid first-person shooter on a handheld is a rare thing, but leave it to Nintendo and the DS to pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SCI/TECH&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Sci/Tech Editor Lisa McKay:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jet in Columbus&lt;/b&gt; does a great job of reporting on an interesting new astronomical discovery in &lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/18/230252.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three New Planets For Puppis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In yet more news from space, &lt;b&gt;Johniac&lt;/b&gt; takes a look at the &lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/18/133359.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Venus Express space probe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the latest edition of SciTech Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Picked by one of last week's chosen authors:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Steven V. Funk:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/19/104014.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;And Now, A Word About The Residents and Ralph Records&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;b&gt;Michael J. West&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Michael gives us a tantalizing sneak preview of the book he's writing about pioneering D.I.Y. record label, Ralph Records.  The Residents have founded the label and become its most notorious band, but there's much more to the story than that.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="authorbio"&gt;Lisa McKay is, among other things, the Sci/Tech editor at &lt;a href="http://blogcritics.org/scitech"&gt;Blogcritics&lt;/a&gt;. In her spare (!) time, she's an artist, a tai chi student, &lt;a href="http://wisdomandmurder.com"&gt;a writer&lt;/a&gt;, and an ardent Elvis Costello fan. She shares her life with her family and two cats, Oscar and Willow. &lt;/div&gt;
