<p>When you first log in, does it show you your mail (your Inbox), or something else? If it shows you something other than your mail, what do they think you were logging in for?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a quick <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> extension request for the throngs of aimless developers waiting to build software at my whim. When reviewing changes to a source code repository, such as <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> or <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a>, most tools offer nice syntax highlighting for the &#8220;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/">diff</a>&#8221; view.</p>

<p>Even on the command line, output of SVN and CVS commands can be &#8220;<a href="http://www.actsofvolition.com/archives/2004/march/learningtolove">piped</a>&#8221; into the command-line utility, <a href="http://colordiff.sf.net">colordiff</a>, for a similar beautification.</p>

<p>Several projects I work on (or hang around pretending to work) have mailing lists of changes to CVS and SVN repositories. I&#8217;d love to see a Thunderbird extension that provided syntax highlighting for the diff format automatically in these emails.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today at <a href="http://www.silverorange.com/">our office</a>, perhaps inspired by the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/pei/features/upei-feedback/">faculty at our local university</a>, there was a rift between management and staff. Early in the afternoon, as the time of day we like to call &#8220;snack-o-clock&#8221; began to approach, there were rumblings of a potential work-stoppage if our (sweet, sweet) demands were not met.</p>

<p>Management was quick to respond and an agreement was reached in time for snack-o-clock. Things are still a little tense, but we&#8217;re all being mature about it.</p>

<p>You can take a look at a <a href="http://actsofvolition.com/images/labour-dispute.jpg" >leaked copy of the agreement</a> that was smuggled out of the high-level negotiations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ecma.ca/">East Coast Music Awards</a> were in Charlottetown this past weekend and I enjoyed some great live music by <a href="http://www.mattmays.com/">Matt Mays &amp; El Torpedo</a>, <a href="http://www.joelplaskett.com/">Joel Plaskett</a>, <a href="http://www.wintersleep.com/">Wintersleep</a>, <a href="http://www.mirwebsite.com/">Mir</a>, and lots of traditional East Coast artists.</p>

<p>The true highlight of the weekend, though, was Cape Breton songwriter <a href="http://www.jp-cormier.com/">JP Cormier</a>&#8217;s banjo jokes. As he brought out his banjo, he shared a joke that divided the crowd sharply into two contingents: people laughing (which was only myself), and everyone else.</p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why are there no banjos in Star Trek?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Because it&#8217;s in the future.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some semi-anonymous browser statistics from a non-technology-related e-commerce website during a one-week period in early February 2006:</p>

<table class="data">
<caption>Browser usage from a mid-sized e-commerce site - February 2006</caption>
<tr>
<td align="right">84.1%</td>
<td>Internet Explorer (97% of these using IE6)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="right">9.6%</td>
<td>Firefox (43% of these using v1.5)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="right">2.5%</td>
<td>Safari</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>A few thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Firefox really <em>does</em> have somewhere around 10% of the market. Most of the other statistics I&#8217;ve seen are skewed towards a more tech-aware crowd and lean more in favour of Firefox.</li>
<li>Almost everyone uses Internet Explorer is up to version 6. It has been out for a few years now, and upgrading is easy, but I&#8217;m still surprised how few people are still on IE 5/5.5. This bodes relatively well for update of IE7 (which is already starting to show up in the statistics in beta form).</li>
<li>A few people (literally, just a &#8220;few&#8221;) use IE5.x for the Mac</li>
<li>Not even one visitor during this week used Netscape 4 or Internet Explorer 4. Not one. I never thought I would live to see such a time.</li>
<li>Mac users are around 4%, Linux users below 0.3%. Someone visited using OS/2!</li>
</ul>

<p>Ah, bullet points - lazy cousin of the paragraph.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having voted earlier this evening for the <a href="http://greenparty.ca/">Green Party</a> in the <a href="http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=ele&amp;document=enr&amp;dir=39ge&amp;lang=e&amp;textonly=false">Canadian federal election</a>, I left the poling station with a strange sensation.</p>

<p>Given all the talk (some of it my own voice) of how little a vote counts, and how ineffectual a partisan political system can be, it is easy to be cynical (and I am) about the value of voting. For example, tonight I voted for a candidate and party who have virtually no chance of winning in my riding. </p>

<p>That said, there is something remarkable about participating in a collective decision with tens of millions of others.</p>

<p>Voting makes me feel small, insignificant, and powerful.</p>

<p><em>Update: Again doing something in common with tens of millions of others, I&#8217;ve turned on the TV to watch some election coverage. I&#8217;m back to feeling cynical.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>
