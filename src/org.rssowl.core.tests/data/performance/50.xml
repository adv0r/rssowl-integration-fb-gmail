<div class="image-right"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chacal/53647532/in/photostream/"><img src='/wp-content/type_1.jpg' alt='' /></a><p>Graphomania[<a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/chacal/">chacal la chaise</a> / <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>]</p></div>If you've been wondering what the greatest work of American fiction has been in the last 25 years, wonder no more.  <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/books/fiction-25-years.html">  surveyed</a> a wide swath of the literary field.  Tony Morrison's <i> Beloved </i> topped the charts with 15 votes and Philip Roth emerged the patriarch of the Great American Novel, having spawned 6, of the 22 finalists.  The results do not surprise but they do leave you pondering the future of American writing--nearly all of the finalists were born in the 1930's--their successors are scarcely around.    

In this hour we're inviting writers, literary bloggers and publishers to discuss American literature: past, present and future. If you ask yourself to name the greatest American novel of the last 25 years do you inadvertently think of writers from other shores, or books written from earlier eras? Are you still reading the American novel or  do memoirs, and short story collections dominate your nightstand stack?  Will the great American novelists of our future be outsiders-- immigrants who can see our society anew?  Will a new, national narrative surface in works of fiction as we begin to digest September 11,  Katrina and the war in Iraq?  Will a writer ever fully supplant <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> or have we outgrown our adolescent angst for good? What are your criteria for the Great American Novel?

[<a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/pdxjeff/">Jeff Muceus</a>/<a href="http://www.flickr.com"  target="_blank">Flickr</a>]</p></div>56, .406, 755  -- baseball's record hit streak, batting average, and home run total: numbers at the intersection of history, myth, memory and, now, at the heart of a lawsuit between ball players and their fantasy fans. Because from these numbers has grown a side business: fantasy baseball now makes an estimated $1 billion a year.

Fantasy baseball is the logical middle-aged move from armchair quarterback to armchair general manager. Once you realize that you'll never be able to hit -- or pitch, for that matter -- a 95 mile-an-hour fastball, once even the childhood <i>fantasy</i> of being able to do so seems remote, suddenly the prospect of maneuvering the people who can -- buying and trading real major leaguers in an imaginary baseball universe -- is better than nothing. Six million people seem to think so.

Fantasy baseball only works because companies provide their customers with real names and real numbers: Albert Pujols and his 20 home runs, Pedro Martinez and his 70 strikeouts. (Every good fantasy relies on a dose of reality, it seems.)

The case reaching U.S. District Court in September was brought by the fantasy sports company CBC, which is asserting it doesn't need to acquire licensing rights in order to use those names and numbers. This is pure public domain information, this is history, this is our national right, CBC argues. Major League Baseball and the Player's Association disagree. This case is not about ownership of stats, MLB lawyers point out; it's about the right of publicity. If you're going to make money from our players' names and achievements, you're going to have to get permission. And you're going to have to pay.

The debate expands quickly past a first set of questions about home runs and ERA. When does performance become identity? Who owns a celebrity's personal persona? And, in the end, what are the commercial boundaries of fantasy?

<div class="image-right"><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/patripics/92702777/"><img src='/wp-content/slaves.jpg' alt='slaves' /></a><p>A memorial in the former slave market of Zanzibar, Tanzania, where over a million slaves were traded between 1811 and 1873. [<a href="http://flickr.com/people/patripics/">Patrick</a>/<a href="http://www.flickr.com"  target="_blank">Flickr</a>]</p></div>[Scheduled for Wednesday May 17, 2006]

Ghanaian poet and scholar <a href=" http://www.transom.org/guests/review/200204.review.lydon.html" target="_blank">Kwadwo Opoku-Agyemang</a> calls slavery "the living wound under the patchwork of scars." Alternately spotlighted and ignored on both sides of the Atlantic, slavery is still the bedrock of modern race relations in the U.S., and the starting point for every conversation about race and class. 

The scar covered wound is an apt metaphor for how we tell our history:  some things get remembered, some don't, some pieces get canonized and some pieces get lost. Most people don't  remember, for example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroon_%28people%29" target="_blank">Maroons</a> - escaped first generation slaves who led guerilla attacks against the British in Jamaica. Nor do most people remember the strange triangulation between black slaves, American patriots, and the British during the Revolutionary War.

Now many new histories are re-examining what we think we already know about a period of time when the Founding Fathers were hashing out the inalienable rights of man, while inscribing the 3/5 personhood of blacks into the Constitution.  

In this show we'll parse some of the hidden, lost, buried, ignored, forgotten, and suppressed stories and histories of slavery. What pieces got left out of the canon of American history? And why? And what does it mean now to unearth them? 

Our main shepherd will be British-born uber-historian Simon Schama, the author of one of these new histories. An 11 on our 1-to-10 scale of good talkers, Schama has, as one review put it, "gained a reputation for challenging established notions of history and culture." He says we're only now starting to understand slavery as an integral part of every aspect of American history. Not just a story in and of itself, but part and parcel of the very foundation and conception of the country. 

Leave your questions here, and reminders of the stories we've lost or ignored.

                <description><![CDATA[[Booked for Tuesday May 16, 2006]

<h4><a href="http://stream.publicbroadcasting.net/ros/open_source_060516.mp3">Click to Listen to the Show (24 MB MP3)</a></h4>

A key question in the first fantasies of Open Source three years ago was whether we could build a radio conversation in which techies would tune in to poets, and poets would tune in on techies.

So here we go -- first time but not the last -- with younger poets reading live in our studio from their own work and taking us inside this paradoxically burgeoning but often isolated world of contemporary poetry, on-line and in book form.  The observation you hear a lot is that poets have become <i>their own audience</i>, but that their voices are heard more dimly in the general culture, published more rarely in places like <i>The New Yorker</i> and <i>The Atlantic</i>, and reviewed less and less commonly in, say, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>.  I'm not even sure the observation is true, but when I Google "poetry blogs" and scan the oceanic range and depth of public poetry just in the US these days, I think: the Web poets now must be as vast and lively an audience as new verse has ever had.  And of course I want to crash the party.

In his <a href="http://www.loc.gov/bicentennial/programs_poem.html">Favorite Poem Project</a> Pinsky found the living pulse of public poetry, from the street-corner to the White House -- and,  with it, vindicated the suspicion that poetry old and new is a roaring stream in the heads of ordinary people.

With us at our inaugural poetry party: <a href="http://www.nh.gov/nharts/artsandartists/2006%20Fellows/margaretdietz.htm">Maggie Dietz</a>, whose first book of poetry, <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=0226148505">Perennial Fall</a>, just out from the University of Chicago Press, reminds me of the voice of the late Raymond Carver: acquainted with suffering and much longing, tough-minded, rigorous, and sometimes gorgeous in the flow of sounds and images.  As in her poem "The Yellow House, 1978," which seems to place the poet as a small child in her mother's Wisconsin kitchen:

<blockquote> To be in that room must be what it was like to be the man

next to her at night, or the child who, at six o'clock had stood
close enough to smell the wool of her sweater through the steam,
and later, at the goodnight kiss, could breathe the flavor of her hair --

codfish and broccoli -- and taste the coffee, which was darkness
on her lips...<h6> Maggie Dietz, "The Yellow House, 1978," in <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=0226148505">Perennial Fall</a>
</h6></blockquote>

<a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/catalog/results2.pperl?authorid=%2067498">Dan Chiasson</a> is a sly wit and polymath who reminds me more of a very hip (in the sense of knowing) contemporary Emerson.  In his new collection <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/61-140004488x-0">Natural History</a> from Knopf, Chiasson sets a number of poems about poetry in the minds of ancient circus elephants, like this one:

<blockquote>
            ... my friend saw
a man gouge out an elephant's eyes with a shovel,
and the elephant cried, <i>Oh, Murder, I am Murdered!</i>
the way we do -- wordless, comical, like a choir of kazoos:

is that poetry?  Or is poetry picking the scarcest word,
say, "charred" instead of "burned" --
as in "charred in a fire"?  Real life is so raw,
all on its own; it hurts; words should perhaps
protect us from real life.
Perhaps words should be a shield, rather than
a mirror; and maybe poems should be
an ornamental shield, like the shields

gods made for their favorite soldiers,
sons and lovers.  Poems should be
like people's faces by firelight:
a little true, for verification's sake,
but primarily beautiful.  Or like
pomegranates: hard to open at first
but, when you get them open, full of sweet granules
of meaning.
<h6>Dan Chiasson, "Scared by the smallest shriek of a pig, and when wounded always give ground," in <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/61-140004488x-0">Natural History</a> </h6></blockquote>

So, can we talk about poems, poets and what we expect from them in 2006?  Feel free, please, to nominate your own candidates for the next round, and your favorite contemporary poems for our delectation immediately.

	<p>I wish we had the nerve to broadcast from the poets&#8217; corner once a week, with artists reaching far into our past to speak to our future.  I didn&#8217;t hear a merely confessional &#8212; much less &#8220;blithering&#8221; &#8212; moment in the hour.  It felt like consorting with real elephants.  I felt imagination doing its work of slowing us down, and I felt the slowing-down open our imaginations &#8212; just as Robert Pinsky said it&#8217;s supposed to.   The evening was pure pleasure for me.  A plenty of unusually gifted and generous people in the room.  Too much to talk about, and lots of poetry that the audience had never heard before.  Shop talk, too.  I hope the banterama wasn&#8217;t too wearisome.  Thanks to all, including our engineer Mike Wilkins who said just a moment ago, &#8220;Now that&#8217;s what I like to hear on the radio!&#8221;

Here's Stephen J. Hadley, assistant to the president for national security affairs, this weekend on CBS's "Face the Nation": 

<blockquote>The president has been very clear that we are to pursue our intelligence programs within the law.<h6>Stephen J. Hadley, quoted in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/15/washington/15hayden.html">Bush Aide Defends Acts by N.S.A.</a>, <i>The New York Times</i>, May 14, 2006</h6></blockquote>

He's referring to the NSA's newly disclosed practice of collecting data about all of our phone calls, but he could be talking about any number of controversies: signing statements, torture policies, CIA black sites, Guantanamo detention.  We're radio producers, not federal judges, so we aren't qualified to determine whether any of these things are, in fact, legal, but is the administration changing what what the word "legal" means?

Whether something is "legal" or not is ultimately a subjective question, but "legal" traditionally implies some sort of confirmation:  An appellate decision. A Supreme Court decision.  As "science" isn't a paper from a single PhD, but the process of peer review and repeatability that gains that paper wider currency, so "legal" isn't the opinion of a single lawyer, but the question of whether, how and how often that opinion has been confirmed in a court of law.

With every controversy, the Bush administration has produced documents, prepared by attorneys at the White House, at Justice or Defense, averring that its actions are legal.  And so it should be; you would expect any party in a controversy to have a lawyer mount a defense.  But is something legal because you say it is?  There was great dissent even within Justice on the question of foreign surveillance without a FISA warrant: is that process of internal debate enough, or do we need a US court to confirm what the Attorney General is telling us?

Much of how we defend ourselves as a nation is necessarily shrouded in secrecy.  Is it possible, given the need for this secrecy, to determine whether our actions are legal or not?  We're taking a look tonight at a small group of lawyers, placed around several Federal departments, who have taken on the task of defending the legality of each of the administration's decisions.  Is there a common thread in the way these lawyers look at constitutional law?  And is it greater than the sum of each new controversy? 

<i>Thanks to <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home/people/phillip_malone">Phil Malone</a> of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School for helping me understand what "legal" means.</i>

Chris’s Post-Game Analysis
</dt>
	<dd>
I wish somebody (like us, perhaps, this hour) were charging hard at General Hayden&#8217;s assertion that NSA phone surveillance could have thwarted the 911 attack.  We are being asked to swallow the general notion that our security rests on the manipulation of trillions of bits of phone data, not on human judgment.  I imagine the same officialdom saying: if we had &#8212; can you imagine? &#8212; weather satellites in the sky that could monitor big storms and warn us about super-size hurricanes, we could have saved New Orleans from Katrina.  Sir, you had more than ample warning of both disasters, and you slept through the alarm clocks both times.</p>
	<p>Sounds to me like time for two long and boisterous constitutional conventions, in Philadelphia perhaps.  First, on the roughshod one-party rule that seems to have taken over the familiar debating grounds in Washington.  But second, within our own on-line club, we need a tough debate on the dark side of this Total Information Awareness era.  We are just beginning to feel the scary implications of the all-penetrating, all-knowing, all-remembering digital media whose speed and global reach we are in the habit of celebrating.  It&#8217;s the digital revolution that is reading your phone bill and maybe tracking your every spoken syllable.  And the invasive power of that technology might pose a dire threat to our assumptions of American freedom, quite apart from the power lust of the Bushes and their lawyers.

Woke up this morning to the following headline, emailed from <i>Open Source</i>'s fifth Beatle, <a href="http://www.prx.org/user/johnprx">John Barth</a>:

<blockquote>The National Security Agency has been secretly collecting the phone call records of tens of millions of Americans, using data provided by AT&#038;T, Verizon and BellSouth, people with direct knowledge of the arrangement told USA TODAY.

The NSA program reaches into homes and businesses across the nation by amassing information about the calls of ordinary Americans — most of whom aren't suspected of any crime. This program does not involve the NSA listening to or recording conversations. But the spy agency is using the data to analyze calling patterns in an effort to detect terrorist activity, sources said in separate interviews.<h6>Leslie Cauley, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm">NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls</a>, <i>USA TODAY</i>, May 10, 2006</h6></blockquote>

 <blockquote>The White House would not discuss the domestic call-tracking program. "There is no domestic surveillance without court approval," said Dana Perino, deputy press secretary, referring to actual eavesdropping.<h6>Leslie Cauley, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm">NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls</a>, <i>USA TODAY</i>, May 10, 2006</h6></blockquote>

So this is different from the surveilled phone calls to foreign entities that we <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/what-the-nsa-does-and-doesnt-do/">talked about last month</a>.  Judging from the USA TODAY article, it's database of almost every phone call made in America.  <i>Every phone call</i>. 

The administration's response hinges on the word "surveillance."  If they aren't listening, but merely tracking whom you call, how often and when, what can they learn? Have you been calling a Lebanese bakery twice a week?  Do you -- as we do to book this show -- regularly call the Middle East?  Are you having an affair?  Can this information, once collected, be used for something other than counter-terrorism?  And how, exactly, is "data-mining" of <i>every phone call in America</i> going to reveal who is or might be a terrorist?

Woke up this morning to the following headline, emailed from <i>Open Source</i>'s fifth Beatle, <a href="http://www.prx.org/user/johnprx">John Barth</a>:

<blockquote>The National Security Agency has been secretly collecting the phone call records of tens of millions of Americans, using data provided by AT&#038;T, Verizon and BellSouth, people with direct knowledge of the arrangement told USA TODAY.

The NSA program reaches into homes and businesses across the nation by amassing information about the calls of ordinary Americans — most of whom aren't suspected of any crime. This program does not involve the NSA listening to or recording conversations. But the spy agency is using the data to analyze calling patterns in an effort to detect terrorist activity, sources said in separate interviews.<h6>Leslie Cauley, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm">NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls</a>, <i>USA TODAY</i>, May 10, 2006</h6></blockquote>

 <blockquote>The White House would not discuss the domestic call-tracking program. "There is no domestic surveillance without court approval," said Dana Perino, deputy press secretary, referring to actual eavesdropping.<h6>Leslie Cauley, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm">NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls</a>, <i>USA TODAY</i>, May 10, 2006</h6></blockquote>

So this is different from the surveilled phone calls to foreign entities that we <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/what-the-nsa-does-and-doesnt-do/">talked about last month</a>.  Judging from the USA TODAY article, it's database of almost every phone call made in America.  <i>Every phone call</i>. 

The administration's response hinges on the word "surveillance."  If they aren't listening, but merely tracking whom you call, how often and when, what can they learn? Have you been calling a Lebanese bakery twice a week?  Do you -- as we do to book this show -- regularly call the Middle East?  Are you having an affair?  Can this information, once collected, be used for something other than counter-terrorism?  And how, exactly, is "data-mining" of <i>every phone call in America</i> going to reveal who is or might be a terrorist?

China now boasts the biggest migration in human history: some 120 million people so far. It began in the early 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping's "Reform and Opening" (experimentation with free markets and foreign trade) started a tidal wave of migrant workers and entrepreneurs flowing from rural farms to factories in eastern boomtowns -- initially focussed on "overnight cities" like Shenzhen, which grew from a small fishing town to a modern metropolis of 4 million in two decades.

The migrants workers are generally young -- just out of school -- and drawn by stories of making it big in the city. What started primarily as seasonal work for male laborers soon changed to include year-round work and vast numbers of women (so many that some cities like Dongguan are now 70% female). And recently, a number of migrants have started settling in urban areas instead of making their way home after a few years. The laborers typically eat, sleep, and work under one roof -- often for negligible wages, working seven days a week. Sweatshop conditions to some; to others, a chance for a better future. The money they send home is now the biggest source of income in many rural villages.

China's "floating population" is rapidly shifting the country from an agrarian society to an industrialized one -- thereby changing the social fabric of the countryside and creating an urban youth culture with strong hints of individualism, materialism, and feminism. We hope to draw the big economic, social, and political picture of how China is changing and also learn the particular stories of individual migrants: why they left home, what factory life is like, how they learn to make their way in the world, and what it's like to return home to a sleepy village with traditional mores.

The money migrant workers earn -- harvesting produce in California, cleaning houses in Singapore, and tending children in Kuwait-- is meager by the standards of the developed world, but it means everything for their families back home. $232 billion is twice what the world paid out in international aid last year; in Latin America it was more than aid and foreign direct investment combined. This is big business, and economists are just starting to take notice.

This year, the LA Times has been running a series of articles on remittances, calling them <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/remit/la-fg-remit-special,0,7168068.special">"The New Foreign Aid."</a> Policy makers like this line-- they like to shrug off questions about the slim foreign aid budget by coupling those numbers with the huge sums of money that workers are remitting home. It's all going to the same place, right?

Are remittances better suited to help small communities than aid, or are they just signs that aid is failing? What does it mean that workers are making these kinds of sacrifices, and what will it mean when governments learn to depend on those sacrifices? Are remittances a viable development strategy? One <a href="http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~border/list_articles/REQ_Aug2_EmptyRemittanceTowns.html">program in Mexico</a> pledges 3 pesos to every one that is remitted and used toward public works. Spain is starting to encourage the Ecuadorian migrants working there to send money home (largely in response to the Spanish banks in Ecuador who will benefit from the cash flow).  But can remittances provide the kind of meaningful improvements in education and jobs and infrastructure that would mean future generations wouldn't have to leave?

Tell us your stories. Do you send money home? Receive? What do the monthly visits to Western Union mean for your life here, and what do they mean for your family? We want to talk about the big issues here: remittances as development, as political power, as foreign aid, as export revenue. Weigh in.

<div class="update">Update, May 18, 7:30 pm</div>


On our own blog, <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/harnessing-remittances/#comment-11301">Nother</a> has done some reporting, talking to a Brazilian waitress at his restaurant in Somerville, Mass.

<blockquote>I asked her how many of the South Americans we work with are documented. She said “me.” I asked her out of all the Brazilians she knows in her daily life here, what percentage are here “illegally,” she said 90%. During lunch she talked about personal experiences and the experiences of our co-workers in getting into this country. She reacted like no American had ever asked her these questions before, even her husband.

...

Petra told me that the bussers we work with work up to 90 hours a week and send about $2000 home a month. They live in places like Framingham 5 or 6 people to a room. People sleep on the floor. She said they use a fake SSN and claim the maximum dependents. She said if these people were allowed to be here legally they would file properly and it would mean more tax revenue for the government.

...

I asked Petra why she wants to be here, why they all go through this. She said, “here, if you work decent, you have a decent life.” Throughout lunch Petra kept repeating the refrain, “you have no clue.” “Americans have no clue.” She said she feels “so blessed.” She said she did not have electricity till she was 13 years old and even then they used it sparingly. She said the average person in Brazil makes $150.00 a month and they only get paid once a month. They can’t afford air conditioner and to fill up a tank a gas cost $60.00. $3000.00 for a 29’ TV. Her mother pays $300 a month for medicine and if Petra wasn’t sending that money her mother would be dead.<h6>Nother, from a <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/harnessing-remittances/#comment-11301">comment to <i>Open Source</i>, May 18, 2006</a></h6></blockquote>]]></description>

<div class="image-left"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shargr/133434313/"><img src='/wp-content/remitterssized.jpg' alt='Filipinas belly up to the remittance bar in Hong Kong' /></a><p>Filipinas belly up to the remittance bar in Hong Kong [<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shargr/133434313/">Stuart Hargreaves</a> / <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>]</p></div>Migrant workers will remit more than $232 billion to their families this year. The money migrant workers earn -- harvesting produce in California, cleaning houses in Singapore, and tending children in Kuwait-- is meager by the standards of the developed world, but it means everything for their families back home. $232 billion is twice what the world paid out in international aid last year; in Latin America it was more than aid and foreign direct investment combined. This is big business, and economists are just starting to take notice.

This year, the LA Times has been running a series of articles on remittances, calling them <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/remit/la-fg-remit-special,0,7168068.special">"The New Foreign Aid."</a> Policy makers like this line-- they like to shrug off questions about the slim foreign aid budget by coupling those numbers with the huge sums of money that workers are remitting home. It's all going to the same place, right?

Are remittances better suited to help small communities than aid, or are they just signs that aid is failing? What does it mean that workers are making these kinds of sacrifices, and what will it mean when governments learn to depend on those sacrifices? Are remittances a viable development strategy? One <a href="http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~border/list_articles/REQ_Aug2_EmptyRemittanceTowns.html">program in Mexico</a> pledges 3 pesos to every one that is remitted and used toward public works. Spain is starting to encourage the Ecuadorian migrants working there to send money home (largely in response to the Spanish banks in Ecuador who will benefit from the cash flow).  But can remittances provide the kind of meaningful improvements in education and jobs and infrastructure that would mean future generations wouldn't have to leave?

Tell us your stories. Do you send money home? Receive? What do the monthly visits to Western Union mean for your life here, and what do they mean for your family? We want to talk about the big issues here: remittances as development, as political power, as foreign aid, as export revenue. Weigh in.

On our own blog, <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/harnessing-remittances/#comment-11301">Nother</a> has done some reporting, talking to a Brazilian waitress at his restaurant in Somerville, Mass.

<blockquote>I asked her how many of the South Americans we work with are documented. She said “me.” I asked her out of all the Brazilians she knows in her daily life here, what percentage are here “illegally,” she said 90%. During lunch she talked about personal experiences and the experiences of our co-workers in getting into this country. She reacted like no American had ever asked her these questions before, even her husband.

...

Petra told me that the bussers we work with work up to 90 hours a week and send about $2000 home a month. They live in places like Framingham 5 or 6 people to a room. People sleep on the floor. She said they use a fake SSN and claim the maximum dependents. She said if these people were allowed to be here legally they would file properly and it would mean more tax revenue for the government.

...

I asked Petra why she wants to be here, why they all go through this. She said, “here, if you work decent, you have a decent life.” Throughout lunch Petra kept repeating the refrain, “you have no clue.” “Americans have no clue.” She said she feels “so blessed.” She said she did not have electricity till she was 13 years old and even then they used it sparingly. She said the average person in Brazil makes $150.00 a month and they only get paid once a month. They can’t afford air conditioner and to fill up a tank a gas cost $60.00. $3000.00 for a 29’ TV. Her mother pays $300 a month for medicine and if Petra wasn’t sending that money her mother would be dead.<h6>Nother, from a <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/harnessing-remittances/#comment-11301">comment to <i>Open Source</i>, May 18, 2006</a></h6></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="image-left"><a href="http://www.nirrosen.com/"><img src='/wp-content/clerics_01.jpg' alt='clerics again' /></a><p>Posters, and supporters, of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. [<a href="http://www.nirrosen.com/">Nir Rosen</a>]</p></div>Nir Rosen stays out of the Green Zone. Instead, he lives and reports from what he calls the "Red Zone," i.e., the rest of the country. 

In the three years he's spent there since the start of the war, he has been much closer to the heart of the conflict than just about any other foreign reporter. He looks Middle Eastern and speaks Iraqi Arabic, so he can pass for a native. He has a network of close friends in Baghdad's most dangerous neighborhoods, so he can go places that aren't safe for westerners (but really aren't safe for anyone else, either). 

He's just returned to the states from another six week stint in the Red Zone, and paints a disturbing picture of sectarian strife, fear, and paranoia.

<blockquote>You have militias operating openly on all sides. Iraq used to be about the insurgency, but the insurgency is now just the Suni militias. They think the Americans are leaving, so now the real fight is against the Shias. And the Shias are fighting back.<h6>Nir Rosen, in a conversation with <i>Open Source</i>, 5/4/06</h6></blockquote>

Nir Rosen wants to talk about the Iraqi civil war - how intense it is, and how much worse he thinks it's going to get.  He wants to talk about targeted ethnic killings by Sunis against Shias and Shias against Sunis. And he wants to tell us about seeing Muqtada al-Sadr speak before an audience of ten thousand screaming fans ("It was like a Michael Jackson concert"). 

After the bombing of the golden-domed Samarra shrine back in February, we did a <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/civil-war-in-iraq/" target="_blank">show</a> about the broad historic roots of sectarian violence in Iraq. Now we're hoping Nir Rosen can elaborate on that picture in present form, and give us his detailed view from the thick of things.

Chris’s Post-Game Analysis
</dt>
	<dd>
Nir Rosen and Patrick Cockburn confirm the dreaded sense that the American consciousness on the Iraq adventure will have passed from mindless optimism to miserable sadness and resignation, without ever passing through any of the customary stopping-off points &#8212; like realistic study, debate, anger, pain, recrimination or analysis, all of which are still to be visited on us.  Zbigniew Brzezinski&#8217;s <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-brzezinski9oct09,0,4356864.story">American Debacle</a>, already cited by Potter, is required reading &#8212; from the cagey old Cold Warrior who was David Rockefeller&#8217;s private secretary of state before he was Jimmy Carter&#8217;s national security chief.

[<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/io_burn/">io_burn</a> / Flickr]</p></div>Sometimes what the geeks care about is important.  Right now the geeks are talking about "net neutrality," the idea that every packet of information -- a piece of an email, a piece of an mp3 of a radio broadcast -- carries equal importance.  That is, a message from me moves no faster or slower over the Internet than a message from the Queen.  Or from CNN.  Net neutrality isn't protected by any law, it isn't vouchsafed by any regulatory agency, it's just one of the standards that govern the Internet.

The standard may not hold.  Cable and phone companies, the ones who give you broadband access to the Internet, have been hinting that they may start offering faster passage for those who are willing to pay for it, that is, CNN's message will get to you faster than mine does.  It sounds fair.  It's how the free market works, right?  But it could squelch innovation in the places it tends to happen, in smaller companies that tend not to be able to pay a lot of money up front.  Companies like Skype -- which is bringing down the cost of telephone calls -- or, once upon a time, two Stanford grad students who started a project called "Google."

So do we need to start regulating the Internet to protect it?  Is net neutrality what make the Internet what it is, or was it just the free market, and innovation?  Are we worried about the effects of the end of net neutrality on democracy?  Do I want Verizon deciding who can and can't use the Internet to get to me?

The White House Correspondents' Association invited Stephen Colbert to speak last Saturday.  It's a yearly ritual: the press corps, the administration and five b-list Hollywood celebrities get a little drunk together, the President makes fun of himself and then a comedian makes fun of the President.  Then Michael Bloomberg pays for the open bar.  Katrina vanden Heuvel looks good in her gown; Karl Rove looks awkward in his tux.  It's fun.

Only this year Stephen Colbert, invited as a comedian, refused to play ball.  Or, depending on whom you ask, he bombed.  He certatinly didn't kill; to see his performance on C-SPAN, pans to the audience reveal nervous giggles, faint amusement and some shock but certainly no belly laughs.  What he did do was go after the President of the United States, sitting there two seats to his right.  Burying Bush, by praising him.  

<strike>To understand what this means, it's best you watch a bit of it yourself.</strike> (C-SPAN has pulled its coverage of this event from YouTube, <strike>so we can't offer it for you here</strike>.  There are, however, some sound clips from Colbert's speech embedded in our program.)

<a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2006/04/29.html#a8104">Video of Colbert's appearance</a> <i>Thanks, Derrick Pohl!</i>

Is this a work of comedy or agitprop?  Can only the court jester can tell the truth?  Is the White House press corps is already on the case and does it not need a New York-based comedian to speak truth to their power?  Is a video clip on the web the only way to understand Washington?  Do you lose something by actually being there in the room with the administration?  And why has the press in general been so reluctant to cover the Colbert moment, and the blogosphere so eager?

Chris’s Post-Game Analysis
</dt>
	<dd>
The Colbert tour-de-force marks a moment.  It&#8217;s the first time, as <a href="http://greghughes.blogspot.com/">Greg</a> writes, that we&#8217;ve seen George W. Bush looking as publicly uncomfortable and ticked off as two-thirds of us Americans feel about him.  It marks also yet another point, I&#8217;d say, at which the failing media establishment proved helpless to hear what&#8217;s going on and check itself.  Consistently now the institutional media calls to mind that nasty gag about marriage: &#8220;&#8230; a great institution.  But would you really want to spend your life in an institution?&#8221;  All the good fun around the Colbert moment is being recorded in blog world, not in what we used to call &#8220;the press.&#8221;  In Billmon&#8217;s glorious <a href="http://billmon.org/archives/002417.html">Whiskey Bar</a>, for example.  Billmon called in too late for tonight&#8217;s conversation, but we&#8217;ll ask him again.  When people question whether really biting coffee-house prose stylists are emerging on the Web, I ask them: have you read Billmon? Not to confuse the great Billmon with another brilliant Philadelphia blogger, <a href="http://www.boomantribune.com/story/2006/4/30/16633/9222">Booman</a>, who sang his own fine song on the Colbert performance: </p>
	<blockquote><p>
 We should build a statue to Steve Colbert for providing a little dose of justice on a most deserving &#8216;inside Washington&#8217; glitterati. He savaged Antonin Scalia, he savaged John McCain, he savaged the corruption in Washington, he accused the press of being mere stenographers for the administration, he bashed the Washington Post, he brutally attacked the war in Iraq, the President&#8217;s response to Katrina, his failure to address global warming, the budget, the NSA leaks, the Plame affair, the secret prisons, and the torture. Colbert left almost no national disgrace unmentioned, and he pulled no punches. I have nothing but admiration for him. Unsuprisingly, the wingnuts see things somewhat differently&#8230;<br />

Jane Jacobs' 1961 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067974195X/103-2463146-4385442?v=glance&#038;n=283155" target="_blank">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a> is widely acknowledged and accepted as the bible of post-war urbanism. A close observation of the day to day mechanisms of city life, of activity on the streets, and in the parks, and in the shops, it is a detailed assessment of what works and what doesn't, of which factors lead to city success and which lead to failure. Jacobs understood that a city is like a story, with characters (who hang out on the street and watch out for the life of the place), and a plot that hinges on those characters, and she told the story of America's cities in a way that has somehow, very powerfully, endured. 

Her story of cities was a kind of 19th century romanticism, very much pre-industrial, where everyone walked everywhere, where the scale of the city was human, not automotive, and where the the urban ills of the 1960s (urban renewal, highways bulldozing through neighborhoods, segregation, racial tension, and white-flight to the suburbs) were somehow both omnipresent and mysteriously absent. A backdrop and catalyst for her observations.

At a time when Americans seem to be coming back to cities, investing in urban development, restoring "historic" buildings and city cores, people are rediscovering Jane Jacobs and holding up her vision of urban life as blueprint and mantra. You can see and hear her vision in the plans of the New Urbanists (who like to think of themselves as her heirs) and in every mixed-use development from Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon. 

So why is it that her ideas have endured so well? Or, conversely, why is it that they are so popular at this historical moment? What is it that's happening in American cities now that makes Jane Jacobs relevant and worth talking about?  Who's carrying the torch for her today, preserving her ideas and ideals? And, might that somehow be a bad thing?

An hour wasn&#8217;t half long enough.  An eminent Boston architect William Rawn suggested to me this afternoon three very current obstacles to the Jane Jacobs vision, and they would have been fun to talk about: 1.  the &#8220;diva&#8221; designs and &#8220;object buildings&#8221; of the sort that Rem Koolhaas is famous for, as opposed to &#8220;ensemble&#8221; architecture that Bill Rawn is getting famous for; 2.  the whole Asian pattern, notably the new Shanghai of 50-story housing, which would seem to overwhelm the Jane Jacobs idea entirely; and 3. the stubborn resistance in corporate America to street-level retail diversity in big new developments.   So we&#8217;ll find other ways to extend the conversation.

Al Gore still sometimes introduces himself by saying, "Hi, I'm Al Gore. I used to be the next President of the United States." But it seems that, six years after his devastating non-election, he genuinely says it with a sense of fun.

By plunging back into two of his lifelong passions -- the internet and the environment -- it looks like Al Gore has kind of reinvented or rediscovered himself. He's bypassed the channels of mainstream media by sending his biting speeches out through MoveOn.org -- so that any ordinary citizen can read what he actually said. And then blog about it. And he's spent the last years travelling the globe with a Powerpoint presentation on global warming that, hard as it is to believe (Al Gore + Powerpoint?), by all accounts would knock your socks off.

All of which is ironically bringing him back into the mainstream media (check out the cover of this month's <i>Vanity Fair</i>) and into some people's dreams about the 2008 election. So the questions for this hour are: What does Al Gore mean to us now, and what does his resurrection say about the current political atmosphere? Is he really New-and-Improved or is he actually the same stiff man that for some reason we're now ready to hear? Is he a better leader outside politics, or could he possibly stay true to the New Al Gore if he re-entered the fray?

At the end of our show about <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/race-class-and-prisons/" target="_blank">race, class and prisons</a>, Princeton sociologist Bruce Western ran through a quick list of things you could do to help prisoners successfully re-enter society.

<blockquote>There are a whole bunch of things we can do at very low cost right at discharge. We can make sure people are enrolled in Medicaid. Do they have five points of ID, so they can get a driver's license? Do they know about things like the Earned Income Tax Credit? Are there plans for transitional employment and housing? Things like that will help draw people back into society so they can fulfill roles like worker, father, and spouse.<h6>Bruce Western, on <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/race-class-and-prisons/" target="_blank">Open Source</a>, 4/17/06</h6></blockquote>

It's all well and good to talk about fixing the social problems that lead to crime and incarceration. But there are already two million people in America's prisons, and 650,000 people leave prison and re-enter society every year. Given what we know about the negative impact of prison on the lives of these people (and their families), what do we do about <i>them</i>? 

We'd like to talk about the nuts and bolts of re-entry, which Western calls the hot topic in corrections policy right now. What happens once they let you out? How real is the old cliche of being dropped off by bus with twenty dollars and a wave goodbye?  What's the role of the parole system, which keeps millions of people tied to the criminal justice system, and often sends them back to jail? Is is possible to mitigate some of the negative effects of prison with social programs targeted at former inmates? 

Help us jump-start the conversation.

We had a broad sample tonight of a small population &#8212; that is, of people with a passion and a paycheck interest in keeping people out of prison.  Hats off to the dauntless Robin Amer for rounding them up.  Each and all good talkers, and in the aggregate, a showcase of modern varieties of the American language.

In response to Martin Luther King's assassination, schoolteacher Jane Elliott devised a simple yet revealing exercise that helped her students understand the pathology of racism and prejudice-- “The Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes" experiment. This experiment was featured in the 1985 Frontline Documentary, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/divided/etc/friday.html"> A Class Divided </a>.

On April 5, 1968, the day after King was shot Elliott divided her all-white classroom into two groups on the basis of eye color, blue or brown. Those with blue eyes were inferior; those with brown eyes were superior. Within minutes the "superior" students exhibited arrogance and a sense of entitlement while the "inferior" group felt insecure and vulnerable.  The following day, when Elliott reversed the experiment, the children who had been subordinate only the day before quickly took on the role as the oppressor, and vice versa.

Her third graders learned in only two days what some of us fail to learn in a lifetime: what it feels like to be discriminated against and how susceptible we are to acting out the irrational behavior of prejudice and bigotry.

Elliott’s first Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes exercise took place nearly 40 years ago in the small town of Riceville, Iowa.  Today Elliott travels across the world, holding lectures and workshops  to give people an insight into racism and what it feels like to be a minority.  

When we asked Elliott if she’ s surprised that she’s still doing this work she said

<blockquote>
Surprised is an understatement… I am angry and I am disgusted, I am frustrated and I am disappointed... and I am enraged.</blockquote>


In this hour we’ve invited Jane Elliott and others to talk about racism and discrimination in America today.  Have civil rights legislation and affirmative action made a difference?  Has the veneer of political correctness only made racism harder to detect?  Are we hardwired to discriminate? Are our expectations for change unrealistic?  Are we prepared to recognize that the road to true equality is a long one, paved with stumbling blocks?  What are your experiences with racism and discrimination?

So if you're a theoretical physicist, the thing that will place you up there with Einstein is a unifying theory of "quantum gravity" -- in essence a theory of everything -- that brings together two big ideas of the twentieth century: general relativity and quantum mechanics. Einstein's general theory of relativity explains the effect of gravity on the shape of space and the flow of time.

Lots and lots of super-smart physicists have been wrestling with a unifying theory for years, of course.

Already confused? So are we. So we'd like to tour the frontier of physics -- passing through the outer reaches of the universe and the innermost realms of atoms -- to try to understand parts of the cosmos that we can't see directly: black holes, extra dimensions, quarks, and so on. And to puzzle out how they might all fit together. Our guide will be Lisa Randall, particle physicist and cosmologist at Harvard.

So if you're a theoretical physicist, the thing that will place you up there with Einstein is a unifying theory of "quantum gravity" -- in essence a theory of everything -- that brings together two big ideas of the twentieth century: general relativity and quantum mechanics. Einstein's general theory of relativity explains the effect of gravity on the shape of space and the flow of time. And quantum mechanics replaces classical mechanics at atomic and subatomic levels.

It's not an official state visit -- not like <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/visit/india/">Manmohan Singh</a> was granted last year -- but more of a "working visit." And this is more than political pageantry. It means, for example, that President Hu will be having dinner with Bill Gates... but not George Bush. And it means that the Sino-Indo-American geo-political chess match -- which is perhaps more like Canadian doubles, in which the partners switch around a bit -- is getting more interesting all the time. 

There are plenty of short-term questions surrounding the trip: Will China budge on intellectual property, to Gates's satisfaction? Will they revalue the yuan? (And would an abrupt revaluation actually help the U.S.?) 

But the visit -- on the heels of Bush's whirlwind trip of his own to India -- brings to the fore some deeper questions. After a two decade headstart, is the tide moving away from East Asia and toward South Asia? Is India ready to challenge China for primacy in the hyper-developing world?  And who is the business community betting on? The venture capital firms? The outsourcing manufacturers?

In short, who's the power of the new century and who holds the better hand: China, with her strong central command and claims of "stability," or India, with her cacophonous, messy, multi-ethnic democracy?

Riddle me Donald Rumsfeld.  He stands at the podium, gray-suited and grease-combed, archaic as a slide rule; he's ancient but doesn't look old.  He looks, in fact, like Dad, a mid-century version of the guy who disappears with a starched collar every morning to do unfathomable things at the office.  When you ask at day's end what he's been doing he smiles, uncreased and thinly patient, and explains that you can't possibly understand what he does.  It's proper and cute that you ask him, but you're better off letting him handle it, and there is no greater family sin than needless worry.  

And he's tired.  He's been standing all day.

<div class="image-left">

<p>Rumsfeld.  Ford.  Cheney.  One of these guys is replaceable. [<a href="http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/avproj/work2.htm">Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum</a>]</p></div>The act would prove comforting if things were going well in Iraq, but they don't seem to be, and a lot of what's broken in the last five years -- the way we detain and handle prisoners, the way we deploy and equip our military, the way we occupy a country after beating it -- is something that Donald Rumsfeld tried to fix.  He was young once, a whiz kid not quite a generation behind Robert Mcnamara, a wrestler from Princeton with an twenty-something's itch to anger bureaucracy.  Then he ran for Congress, won, internalized that itch, scratched it and and is now still scratching a half-century later.  It sustains him, this itch.  With it he has outlasted Presidents Nixon, Ford and Reagan, and he doesn't look likely to leave Washington before George Bush.

In his eternal war with and within bureaucracies Donald Rumsfeld is a tactical genius, but is his private, metaphorical war with the Pentagon good for America's public and very literal war in Iraq?  "I'm a survivor," he told the troops last year, speaking, of course, of his unparalleled ability to hold on to appointed office.  It's an odd thing to say to an audience for whom survival means actually not getting killed. 

How does he do it?  How has he been doing it for so long?  What does it take to lick every bureaucrat, politician and Joint Chief reckless enough to take him on?

Chris’s Post-Game Analysis
</dt>
	<dd>
There&#8217;s something spooky here.  In Rummy-speak, it&#8217;s about what we know we know, and know we&#8217;re not going to say.  Michael Gordon won&#8217;t say that for the rebellious ex-generals it&#8217;s a straightforward matter of competence: the arrogant Rumsfeld didn&#8217;t know what he was doing, and made no correction when he saw his deck chairs going askew.  Rumsfeld refuses to register a moment&#8217;s doubt about what he&#8217;s done, and asks us to imagine that five years down the road, this blundering and death in the desert will be reimagined as a brilliant stroke.  The poet Jim Behrle &#8212; and we who invited him &#8212; put forward the premise that someday it will all seem funny, or coherent as some sort of personal statement.  What none of us want to address is the carnage before our eyes today, or whenever we want to peek beyond the euphemism and sanitized imagery around this war.  Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=2006041322552586">sample from the Web</a>, not for the faint-hearted, of what much of the world beyond our shores sees all the time.  It seems too shocking, too sad, to talk about, so we talk instead about Rummy&#8217;s survival skills.

[Booked for Wednesday, May 10]

In our recent <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/immigration-stories/">immigration show</a>, our guests noted that thousands of illegal Mexican immigrants are crossing into the U.S. because following the NAFTA agreement cheap -- read subsidized -- American corn has flooded the Mexican market. These one-time farmers just can't compete against U.S. corn on their soil, so they often end up picking fruit on ours.

It's one of many unintended consequences that follow from cheap corn, and it got us talking that night in the control room. We realized that corn (or corn subsidies) is one of those topics that often comes up in odd contexts. When you think you're talking about illegal immigration, or diabetes, or energy policy, or environmental degradation, or presidential politics, it turns out that you're also, and often inevitably, talking about corn.

So we'd like to try the reverse: start with corn itself and see where it leads us.
