<title>Guess what Mac OS X crashes also</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I have seen this screen a few times and did not realize it was the Mac equivalent of a BSOD. Which the only one I have seen in recent years was when I had a hard drive failure several months ago.

<title>Verizon reporting your late payment to credit agency is gift!</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Well with a gift like that it makes you wonder what they do when they send a collection agency or fire someone as an employee. What company in there right mind would say that reporting your late payment is a gift. Sure we all don't like to see negative stuff on our credit report but it is hardly a gift. So I suppose this post is a gift to Verizon, I wonder what other kinds of gifts I can give them.

<title>First Commercial PC with NAND Flash Based Solid State Disk</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Samsung has released the first commercially released computer with a 32 gig solid state disk. This is good news as I am getting tired of replacing hard-drives. I realize of course that the memory size is pretty small but it's a start. Just think of the energy savings as standard hard-drives account for a large portion of the heat coming out of a PC. I would imagine that it will not take manufactures long to get disk sizes up to a respectable size.

<title>GoDaddy Renews Geek News Central Sponsorship</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I am happy to announce the GoDaddy has renewed the sponsorship of the Geek News Central Podcast. The relationship that started a year ago, is paying off in big ways for a lot of Podcasters. I am happy to have been the catalyst for their involvement in the wider podcasting space. </p>

<p>They folks at GoDaddy realize the power of the medium, and have become heavily invested across multiple networks and podcasts, but least they forget this show is where the advertising model was validated. That being said check the show out because we have some special access codes you will not hear anyplace else that will get you some very significant savings on domains and hosting accounts.  <u>If your company is looking to start advertising in the podcasting space I can get you connected to a large family of shows and podcasts <a href="mailto:podcast@podcastconnect.com">podcast@podcastconnect.com</a></u></p>

<p>I look forward to bringing some cool give aways in the month of June as part of the one year celebration, in the form of Cash Prizes, and <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/default.asp?isc=gnc07c">GoDaddy Domain's and service giveaways</a>. </p>]]></description>

<title>Microsoft&apos;s lack of action will slow Podcasting Growth</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Well it is pretty obvious that Microsoft did not get Podcasting support built into Windows Media Player 11 and all I can say is that they obviously blew it. I have been debating what to say for a few days. My summation is not fit to print, what I really don't understand is how they could have been so stupid.</p>

<p>They had a opportunity with Windows Media Player 11 to get in the game, I can guarantee that their inaction will slow the growth of podcasting in a big way. But it makes sense Podcasting does not make them any money, if I were a betting man I bet MTV had something to say in the process and likely killed any podcasting integration as it would have made the URGE network a lesser value.</p>

<p>They obviously do not support citizen media nor do they respect those of us that are on the Windows platform and those that have MP3 players that don't have the Apple logo on them. One thing for sure is that Steve Jobs understands the power of the medium and have made the integration a priority.</p>

<p>We are approaching 1 year of Podcast integration into iTunes and yet to this date Microsoft is so completely and utterly out of the game that there actions will assure that the iPod and the Apple line gain market share within this community.</p>

<p>The e-mail that i have gotten from listeners and podcasters are agonizing to read, because they are all disgusted and pissed of with the Windows Media Player team. It's time for Microsoft to allow those people at Microsoft that understand this medium to break out and make some things happen.</p>

<p>What's the solution well I am not sure firing anyone would help because they move at the speed of a snail. At this very moment in time all I can say is Microsoft and especially the Windows Media Player team you Suck!</p>]]></description>

<title>How to compete with FeedBurner</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I don't normally point twice to the same website in one day but Dave has some great points about how to create a FeedBurner competitor. I personally would be happy if it was either built into my blog application or was a plugin. What they are doing over their is not rocket science.</p>

<p>To this day I do not understand why people out-source the delivery of their RSS feed to FeedBurner when nearly all blog applications have a built in RSS feed. If people want to read my content they can visit this website if they want to subscribe to the RSS feed they do so like everyone else with a aggreator. In fact I would discourage people from reading my RSS feed online through there browser that defeats the purpose of site branding.

<title>FeedPass do not republish our feeds!</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Anytime I see a service that has the potential to cause ones feed to be Hijacked it gets my attention. Looking at the FeedPass interface I became instantly aware that anyone could take our feed and sign up for an account, have Google Ads inserted and start making revenue by placing that same content on a service that could feed up my RSS feed and someone else's advertisements.</p>

<p>I am putting <a href="http://www.feedpass.com/">FeedPass</a> on notice that if I find any feeds from any of our companies being hijacked and ran thru their service that we are going to hold them liable.</p>

<p>I don't need stats or help from any third party in figuring out what my stats are and I don't want anyone coming across our content subjected to advertisements in our RSS feed. [<a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/05/20.html#When:11:21:26PM">Scripting News</a>]</p>]]></description>

<title>Free Promotion Opportunity!</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Every month the membership at the Tech Podcast Network put on a live event Saturday afternoon to talk about cool and innovative products. This month we are finalizing our agenda for our Live event on June 3rd and I thought I would extend an opportunity to any tech company that would like to come on and demonstrate there product, website or service. We have some time slots available.</p>

<p>The attendance is usually around 50 participants but once we post the video of the event we have had as high as 25,000 downloads with an average of 10,000 downloads for the longtail exposure. Free publicity for your company that money can't buy. </p>

<p>If you want to participate drop a line to tech@techpodcasts.com with the subject roundtable presenter with your contact information, product you want to demo and your website. </p>]]></description>

<title>Restore Web Braille Petition</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Seems copyright fears has caused a site that was of immense value to the visually impaired. Here is a segment of a e-mail I received. [<a href="http://www.RestoreWebBraille.com/">www.RestoreWebBraille.com</a>]</p>

<p>"Essentially the National Library Service For The Blind (NLS) pulled the plug on a service called Web Braille that allowed only authenticated users to download Braille files in a BRF format of books and magazines in the NLS library collection.  These files are readable on devices with refreshable Braille displays or other text-to-speech enabled players.   While NLS has not released any official reason for the cessation of service, it is believed it is due to fears about copyright restrictions."<br />

<title>Skype Out Free to US and Canadian Number till end of 2006</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The folks at Skype in a absolute amazing marketing move has made calling any United States or Canadian telephone number a free call. That's right you can call any land line phone from your computer for free. This is HUGE, the calls had already been cheap but this opens up Skype to those that may have been resistant to depositing credits for the account.

<title>Call Records and the Political Flap</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Anyone that takes a few minutes and studies what has transpired over the past few days will have to sit back and really ask themselves a couple of questions. First of all some political opponents of the President are standing up and calling for hearings and making conspiracy comments, yet at the same time it has been revealed that these same political party members attended the closed door briefings on this issue and congressional delegations apparently visited the NSA as well. But as they stand in front of a camera they conveniently neglect to mention that they had been read into the program.</p>

<p>What is also amazing from a technical perspective is that unless you have been living under a rock is that call records have been available a very long time  that allow Joe average citizen to buy call records. Everything I have read and seen indicates no voice conversations were recorded.</p>

<p>The government employee who revealed the information though needs to be found!  Individuals that reveal classified material in this way need to have the book thrown at them. You know what they say "loose lips sink ships", In this case Loose Lips may cause Americans to be harmed when terrorist change there tactics, and make it harder for those that protect us to do their jobs.</p>

<p>I am all about privacy but I am also realistic enough to understand that there are probably people living among us that want nothing more than to destroy the fabric of our society. God forbid another attacks happen against this country, but when, and if it does we should hope that these irresponsible individuals that have loose lips, that in all likelihood have diminished our countries capacity to prevent such events are found out, tried and punished accordingly.</p>]]></description>

<title>Google Trends</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>A nice tool that Google launched today is called Google Trends although I am not overly impressed it does allow you to search and compare terms. This will be a good measure for companies that want to compare brands, specific products and any other combinations to see where the trend is for those terms in relation to search.

<title>AIM Pages not Impressive</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>If the plan for AOL was to compete with MySpace with AIM Pages then by the look of the site today it is dead on arrival. Heck it does not even work in Firefox and some are saying even Safari users are having trouble. The site reminds me of GeoCities from the 80's in fact I wonder if they actually used some of that code. [<a href="http://www.aimpages.com/">www.aimpages.com</a>]</p>

<p>Update: This <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2006/05/10/aimpages-is-f-ing-hot/">post</a> by Jason Calacanis is an indication that he has drank to much of the AOL Koolaid. Your kidding Right?</p>]]></description>
