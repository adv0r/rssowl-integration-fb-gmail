       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-na-scotus23may23,1,6027378.story?ctrack=1&cset=true">the Supreme Court unanimously found</a> that police who peer into windows and see a fight going on inside can forcibly enter without announcement and without a warrant.</p>

<p>It's a tricky issue.  We certainly don't want police waiting around for a warrant when there's clearly something amiss.  But then, we don't want them peeping in windows looking for reasons to break down doors, either.  It is comforting that the Court said objective facts are important in determining whether or not an officer may legally enter a home, not the officer's motives.  </p>

<p>That would presumably rule out situations in which an officer <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/archives/019187.php">misinterprets playful desert games for domestic violence</a>.</p></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.madison.com/wsj/mad/local/index.php?ntid=84994">Dodgeville, Wisconsin:</a><blockquote>Members of a drug task force burst into a Dodgeville apartment Monday night and arrested two people before officers realized that they were in the wrong apartment.</p>

<p>Richland-Iowa-Grant Drug Task Force members entered the apartment about 10:15 p.m. and arrested its two occupants in what police considered a "high-risk" drug bust, according to the Dodgeville Police Department. Minutes later, they realized that they were in the wrong place and released the occupants.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Task Force Director Lt. Scott Marquardt said the task force was reviewing what led to the accidental arrests. He said the task force was sorry for what happened to the innocent neighbors.</p>

<p>"We're very disappointed," Marquardt said. "We regret the stress and the inconvenience that we caused. That's not how we do business."</blockquote>Good thing it wasn't a member of Congress.  Then they'd <em>really</em> be in trouble.</p></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday, the <em>Houston Chronicle</em> <a href="http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v06/n645/a03.html?18026">ran a fluff piece</a> on DEA administrator Karen Tandy.  Among the lowlights:<blockquote>"I have two teenaged daughters and I'm no different than any other parent - I worry about my kids.  They are great kids, but peer pressure can be a big issue."</p>

<p>Her use of maternal instinct may partly explain why during her 32 months as DEA chief, Tandy has been an unapologetic advocate for tough enforcement of laws against marijuana, a substance critics say is less destructive than heroin or cocaine. </p>

<p>"We have more teens in ( counseling ) for marijuana than for all other drugs combined, including alcohol," she said recently in her office in the agency's northern Virginia headquarters.  </p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Regardless of the occasional critic's shot, Tandy retains her passion for running the government's largest anti-drug bureaucracy - the kind of job that can be stressful and emotionally exhausting. </p>

<p>"This job is a calling, not just for me but for all of the 11,000 people in this agency.  I have the best job on Earth," she said.  </p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>In the Justice Department, Tandy was a pioneer in the enforcement of asset forfeiture law - a government tactic used to deprive drug merchants of material gain by seizing planes, boats, ranches and more exotic possessions such as strip clubs and golf courses bought with drug cash. </p>

<p>By 1993, she was running the narcotics office at Justice, which put her on the path to being appointed by President Bush to head the DEA in 2003. </p>

<p>With her background in asset forfeiture, Tandy has focused on going after the money of drug pushers. </p>

<p>"When I came through the door, I made money the No.  1 priority," she said.</blockquote>Obviously, I have a rather different take on Tandy's tenure (which started, incidentally, with her <a href="http://www.mpp.org/releases/nr062603.html">cowering and fleeing</a> to avoid a Capitol Hill confrontation with Suzanne Pfeil, a wheelchair-bound medical marijuana and post-polio patient who <a href="http://www.paralinks.net/paralinksarchives/suzanne_pfeil.html">woke up one morning</a> to the barrel of an assault weapon toted by a DEA goon).

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/030493.php">Via Glenn Reynolds</a>:<blockquote>An unusual FBI raid of a Democratic congressman's office over the weekend prompted complaints yesterday from leaders in both parties, who said the tactic was unduly aggressive and may have breached the constitutional separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of government.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>About 15 FBI agents, <strong><em>wearing suits</em></strong>, entered Jefferson's office in the Rayburn House Office Building about 7:15 p.m. Saturday and left about 1 p.m. Sunday. Authorities said it was the first time the FBI had raided the office of a sitting congressman.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>Former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), in an e-mail to colleagues with the subject line "on the edge of a constitutional confrontation," called the Saturday night raid "the most blatant violation of the Constitutional Separation of Powers in my lifetime." He urged President Bush to discipline or fire "whoever exhibited this extraordinary violation."</p>

<p>Many legal experts and defense lawyers agreed with Gingrich. Charles Tiefer, a University of Baltimore law professor who served as solicitor and deputy general counsel of the House for 11 years, called the raid "an intimidating tactic that has never before been used against the legislative branch."</blockquote>I understand the constitutional concerns, though I don't find them convincing.</p>

<p>What's amusing are the concerns about "imtimidation," and the raid being "unduly aggressive."  Are you kidding me?  Do something about <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/archives/cat_paramilitary_police_raids.php">this</a>, you cowards, then we'll talk about whether or not men in <em>suits</em> conducting a rather civil search of an <em>office</em> constitutes unnecessary aggression.</p></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1110AP_Prison_Population.html">According to new data</a> from the U.S. Department of Justice, one in 136 Americans is behind bars today, including an astounding 12 percent of all black men between the ages of 25 and 29.  The United States represents 4.6 percent of the world's population, but houses nearly 23 percent of humanity's prison population.  Certainly, part of this is likely due to politicians' unfortunate habit of <a href="http://www.catostore.org/index.asp?fa=ProductDetails&method=cats&scid=33&pid=1441226">addressing every social problem with a new law</a>, but much of it is due to our ever-more-draconian drug laws.  A few more statistics to chew on from the latest edition of <a href="http://www.drugwarfacts.org/"><em>Drug War Facts</em></a>, published by Common Sense for Drug Policy:<blockquote><li>As of 2005, drug offenders accounted for 55 percent of the federal prison population.  About 45 percent of them were in prison for possession, not trafficking.</p>

<p><li>The number of people incarcerated in federal prisons for drug crimes rose from 14,976 in 1986 to 68,360 in 1999.</p>

<p><li>It costs U.S. taxpayers $3 billion per year to keep drug offenders behind bars in federal prisons.</p>

<p><li>Drug offenders have accounted for nearly half the meteoric growth in prison populations since 1995.</p>

<p><li>About half the population of U.S. jails and prisons are nonviolent offenders, more than the combined populations of Wyoming and Alaska.</p>

<p><li>Forty percent of the more than 1,000 state prisons in the U.S. opened in just the last 25 years.  The state of Texas alone has opened an average of 5.7 new prisons each year for the last 21 years.  Despite this, about half of federal and state prisons operate over capacity.</p>

<p><li>Total U.S. inmates numbered 488,000 in 1985, 1.3 million in 2001, and number 2.2 million today.</p>

<p><li>According to survey data by human rights groups, one in five U.S. prison inmates has been sexually assaulted.</p>

<p><li>According to federal sentencing guidelines, a man would need to possess 50 times more powder cocaine (prefered by white users) than crack cocaine (prefered by black users) to earn the same prison sentence.</p>

<p><li>Blacks represent about 12 percent of the U.S. population, but 48 percent of the prison population.  They represent just 13 percent of drug users, but 38 percent of those arrested for drug crimes, and 59 percent of those convicted.</p>

<p><li>When convicted of the same drug felony, blacks are about 50 percent more likely to be sentenced to prison than whites.</p>

<p><li>A black woman's chances of spending some time in prison over the course of her life (5.6 percent) is about equal that of a white man (5.9 percent).  For black men, the odds are nearly one in three (32.2%).</p>

<p><li>Before Congress passed mandatory minimums for offenses related to crack (but which didn't apply to powder cocaine) in 1986, the average drug-related sentence for blacks was 11 percent higher than for whites.  After that law, the disparity jumped to 49 percent.</blockquote>Despite all of this, overall drug use in this country hasn't substantially abated.  <a href="http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/druguse/#table1">According to government survey data</a>, the percentage of people reporting illicit drug use in their lifetimes rose from 31.3 percent in 1979 to 35.8 percent in 1998.   Between 1999 and 2001, the figure went from 39.7 to 41.1 (data prior to 1998 isn't comparable to data after 1998 due to changes in methodology).   The percentage of college students reporting having used marijuana in the last year went from 27.9 percent in 1993 to 33.7 percent in 2003; the number using in the past month went from 14.2 percent to 19.3 percent; and the number reporting daily use went from 1.9 percent to 4.7 percent. </p>

<p>Interestingly, all of these increases have come from people over 18 years of age. Drug use among minors is significantly down.  Which means that even as adult Americans are more likely to take recreational drugs than they once were (and given <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/05/16/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-guardrails/">these figures</a>, with little corresponding social harm), they're doing a good job of steering their kids away from them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the government continues to arrest and incarcerate drug offenders, and in fact is now expanding its reach to include not just recreational users and traffickers, but <a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3778">doctors</a> and <a href="http://www.cato.org/events/010327pf.html">patients</a> who use controlled drugs to treat illnesses in ways the drug warriors have determined are "outside the scope of legitimate medical practice."</p>

<p>One wonders what percentage of Americans will need to be in prison before our politicians find the courage to say "enough."</p></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.05/posts.html?pg=7">Lawrence Lessig</a> tells how H&R Block and the tax preparation industry have defeated plans to simplify the tax code at the state and national level, then offers a lesson for the GOP:<blockquote>Free markets aren't pro-business - they don't favor incumbent companies if upstarts do the job better. Competition is good wherever it comes from - even the government - so long as it lowers social costs and increases wealth. And efficiency is good regardless of who it might hurt; it is especially good if it hurts those who feed off inefficiency. Thus, lawyers are good, but a world that needed fewer of them would be much better. Doctors are great, but that's no argument against better health. And TurboTax is fantastic, but it shouldn't prevent the government from making paying taxes easier.</blockquote>Lessig blames part of the problem on the corrupting influence of money in politics.  That may be.  But the "fix" is too severe, butts heads with the First Amendment, and isn't likely to work anyway.  What we all need to realize is that so long Congress continues to spend at a clip equal to 20 percent of the GDP, and so long as politicians use the tax code as a behavior modifier, they'll continue to subject themselves to corrupting influences.  With that kind of money being handed out, it's only natural that everyone and his brother would hire a lobbyist to help procure himself a piece.</p></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.rawstory.com/showoutarticle.php?src=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB114808152438358490-d2afgc_Jjqve_55Tj_bHj_iNCu4_20070519.html?mod=rss_free">Disturbing article</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> about the federal government's habit of strong-arming private corporations into giving up consumer data, often for no-more than fishing expeditions, and not just for terrorism, but for all sorts of other crime (despite the fact that laws making such expeditions easier where predicating on fighting terrorism):<blockquote>Banks, Internet-service providers and other companies that possess large amounts of data on their customers say that police and intelligence agencies have been increasingly coming to them looking for tidbits of information that could help them stop everything from money launderers to pedophiles and terrorists.</p>

<p>"Corporate counsel that used to see law-enforcement-related requests five times a year are now getting them sometimes dozens of times a day," says Susan Hackett, a senior vice president and top attorney for the Association of Corporate Counsel, which represents the legal departments of leading U.S. companies.</p>

<p>In short, phone companies currently caught up in a controversy over reports that they gave the National Security Agency access to records of customers' calls are hardly the only businesses fretting over how to cooperate with the government in the war on terror. Internet and financial companies also are frequently targeted by intelligence and law enforcement agencies, forcing them into situations where they must choose between customers' rights to privacy and their own corporate desire to help the government without being seen as agents of the government.</p>

<p>The situation is made even more complicated when the companies are government contractors, vying for federal business or in an industry subject to complicated regulation.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>In other cases, companies have no choice but to surrender records. New powers granted to the government under the Patriot Act mean that Washington can secretly access people's records from businesses without having to provide any notification or seek a judge's permission. Companies are in fact prohibited by the law from disclosing that they had received such requests.</p>

<p>The Justice Department last month reported that the FBI last year issued 9,200 administrative subpoenas known as National Security Letters, seeking information on 3,501 U.S. citizens and legal residents from their banks, credit card, telephone and Internet companies without a court's approval. The records are supposed to be about people in terrorism and espionage investigations, but the FBI is not required to show how they are connected to any terrorism case.</p>

<p>Some companies have been wrestling with how far to cooperate with government investigations even before 9-11. AOL first noticed law-enforcement agencies' burgeoning interest in their members' online activities in the mid-90s in child-porn cases. FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. struggled with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Agency over the agencies' attempts to get unfettered access to the shippers' systems as part of the war against drug traffickers.</p>

<p>Since 2001, the pressure on them has grown as the amount of electronic information provided to or compiled by companies has grown to include everything from customer names and addresses to shopping preferences and pastime activities. The Departments of Homeland Security, Defense and Justice as well as the CIA have increasingly viewed this data as a veritable treasure trove that can be tapped to help thwart crimes and identify potential terrorist attacks in the making.</blockquote>As if all that weren't already disturbing enough, the article doesn't get into just how much money fightint and/or complying with these requests can cost the companies subected to them (which they of course then pass on to you).  Cato's Tim Lynch <a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=2948">tackled that problem</a> in <em>Forbes</em> a few years ago.</p></p>

       <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/jonahgoldberg/2006/05/17/197681.html">Jonah Goldberg's provocatively-titled column</a> this week ("What If Mexicans Were Crack?) is puzzling. He begins by comparing immigration to the Drug War, noting that in both cases, government is attempting to violate the laws of suppy and demand through brute force.</p>

<p>Fair enough. But he falters a bit here:<blockquote>Charges of racism echo each other in both debates as well. Somehow, it's the fault of those favoring border security that most illegal immigrants are Mexicans and the fault of drug warriors that minorities are disproportionately in the drug trade.</blockquote>I think the racism charges in the immigration debate have more to do with those who oppose immigraton from Mexico but welcome immigration from, say, Europe (note, I'm not advancing that charge -- there are far more compelling arguments against the anti-immigration position).</p>

<p>As for racism and the Drug War, Goldberg's mistaken. Proportionately, blacks represent a far higher percentage of those incarcerated for drug crimes than they do of drug dealers and users. According to a DOJ survey in 1998, a black man is more than 50 percent more likely to get prison time when charged with the same drug offense as a white man. In 1986, the federal government initiated mandatory minimums for crack cocaine (the form of cocaine favored in black communities) but not for powder cocaine (the form prefered by whites). In 1990, Congress exacerbated the disparity -- the new law, introduced by Sen. Jesse Helms, meant a drug offender would have to possess 50 times as much powder cocaine to get an equivalent sentence for possession of crack, despite the fact that there's no difference in the chemical makeup of the two drugs. The result: The averge federal drug sentence for blacks stands at about 49 percent higher than the average drug sentence for whites.</p>

<p>From there, Goldberg's column gets more bizarre. Drawing on his immigration-crack comparision, Goldberg then chastises advocates for drug leagalization for their inconsistency on the immigration issue. He writes:<blockquote>Some drug legalization advocates hang their position on a lot of moral preening about the absolute right of the individual to do what he wants. But many of the same people will then argue that it is - and should be - an outrageous crime to hire an illegal immigrant.</blockquote>To read Goldberg's take, one would think most drug reformers are anti-immigration. That's just not the case.  Most prominent opponents of the Drug War I can think of also hold fairly liberal views on immigration. Perhaps there are a couple of people who fit Goldberg's description (my guess is that they work at <em>National Review</em>), but it's not a dichotomy that's all that prevalent in the drug reform movement, or among libertarians.  And I certainly don't think there are enough people holding both views to merit an entire column attacking them.</p>

<p>Goldberg goes on:<blockquote>Most opponents of the drug war came to their position because they consider the effort worthy in principle, but ultimately futile in the face of a more determined "enemy," and a bit silly since the gains of winning aren't that important to them.</blockquote>No. Most opponents of the drug war aren't utilitarians. Most came to our position because drug laws create consensual crimes, because we don't feel it's the government's responsibility to tell it's citizens what they can and can't put into their bodies, and because it's certainly not the government's function to enforce those laws by throwing people in prison, and by eviscerating the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>The vast majority of us also see no reason why the government should prevent willing laborers from freely contracting with willing employers.</p>

<p>In other words, there's no inconsistency here. </p></p>
