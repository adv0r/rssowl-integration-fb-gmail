    <title>What's the most fuel-efficient car available?</title>
    <link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/ask/rss/*http://ask.yahoo.com/20060524.html</link>
    <description>With cars becoming more efficient, you might think oil companies are hurting for profits. Ha, yeah, right! Companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron have never been stronger, thanks in part to chumps (like us) paying record prices and continuing to drive inefficient vehicles...</description>

    <title>Do earlobes have a purpose?</title>
    <link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/ask/rss/*http://ask.yahoo.com/20060523.html</link>
    <description>Earrings aren't good enough for ya? Maybe gauging is a higher purpose? If not, well, you'll just have to accept that earlobes are a vestigial structure, an evolutionary hiccup, a leftover bit of flesh that has to make do with getting punctured for fun...</description>

    <title>Can you really count the seconds between lightning and thunder to figure how far away a storm is?</title>
    <link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/ask/rss/*http://ask.yahoo.com/20060522.html</link>
    <description>Thunder is the sound of rapidly heated air expanding and vibrating, and shock waves. Light travels faster than sound, so we see the lightning before we hear the resulting thunder. Using the speeds of light and sound as well as the atmospheric conditions, you could calculate exactly how far away the storm is...</description>

    <title>What really happens if you don't pay a parking ticket?</title>
    <link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/ask/rss/*http://ask.yahoo.com/20060519.html</link>
    <description>Let's face it, if Osama bin Laden and a meter maid both came strolling toward your car, you'd probably think, "Oh no, here comes a meter maid." Parking tickets -- a nuisance to some, source of nightmares to others. So why pay?...</description>

    <title>Who plays "Jack" in the Jack in the Box commercials?</title>
    <link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/ask/rss/*http://ask.yahoo.com/20060518.html</link>
    <description>Ronald McDonald isn't the only clown with a fast-food empire. "Jack" (or "Mr. Box" as he's professionally known) has been the grotesquely oversized face of Jack in the Box for years.

Join us for one of our more greasy investigations...</description>
