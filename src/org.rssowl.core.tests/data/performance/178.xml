			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://geeks.opml.org/2006/05/24#a877&quot;&gt;A utility script&lt;/a&gt; that runs in the OPML Editor (or Frontier or Radio) that lists the enabled threads and everyMinute scripts that might be slowing your system down. It found a few problems on my system. </description>

			<title>I Still Say No to Web Two Oh</title>
			<link>http://www.scripting.com/2006/05/24.html#iStillSayNoToWebTwoOh</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;Richard MacManus &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/coming_to_terms.php&quot;&gt;relents&lt;/a&gt;, and decides that Web 2.0 is here to stay, and Mike Arrington sighs in relief and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=213&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; why he remains loyal to the concept. &lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Me, well, I've always believed in the Two-way Web, back before it was hip. I even coined the term &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/2001/02/19/internet30&quot;&gt;Internet 3.0&lt;/a&gt;, to describe the P2P level that came after RSS and XML-RPC and SOAP. Some part of me is sure that this was the inspiration for the creation of the new moniker.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;What I object to about &quot;Web 2.0&quot; is that it was created to exclude people from the conversation, and by the way, I'm one of those people. They're planning the third Web 2.0 conference, and I haven't gotten an invite to present, and I'm not holding my breath. &lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Mix 06 conference was an obvious attempt to hop on the same bandwagon, again, no invite to speak (they wanted me in the audience, but I don't believe in audiences anymore, so thanks but no thanks). &lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Tim Berners-Lee &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5009250.stm&quot;&gt;warns&lt;/a&gt; of a dark net, but we don't need to wait for that, it's already here, in Silicon Valley and South of Market. It's the web of them, not us, and you need not apply, because it's going to stay that way.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;I love and admire Mike and Richard, and I'm glad they're welcomed by the owners of Web 2.0, but until they put out a welcome mat for everyone else, I'm going to keep looking to the future, because I think that kind of exclusivity belongs in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;And Mike, if you wanted to get rid of the problem, one call to O'Reilly or Battelle right now would probably take care of it. And mention it to Kevin Werbach as well. That you and so many others quietly &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=acquiesce&quot;&gt;acquiesce&lt;/a&gt; allows the exclusivity to continue. Until then, I'm going to keep looking for a route-around, and some day, hopefully soon, we'll find it.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>What prompted this piece</title>

			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I read The Accordion Guy's &lt;a href=&quot;http://accordionguy.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2006/5/24/1981829.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; explaining how Toronto could become Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;I groaned out loud. Please, let's figure out how Silicon Valley could be more like Toronto. SV is a boring place with a totally shitty attitude, it's trouble with a capital T. This boom-bust cycle isn't something I'd wish on a city I hate, and Toronto is such a &lt;i&gt;nice&lt;/i&gt; place. &lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Sure, you want to be rich, but there's a nice way to be successful and an ugly way. Silicon Valley isn't nice. But the sentiment is real. Lots of people have envious feelings when they look at this place. And that's by design. Keep doing what you're doing, create inclusivity, welcome all comers, and you'll be where Silicon Valley was in the middle of the last century. Where it is now is not good.&lt;/p&gt;
