    <title>Millionaire Candidates</title>
    <link>http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_05_21_atrios_archive.html#114849788888295156</link>
    <description>I've actually never had a huge problem with self-funded millionaire candidates - it's a problem with the system not with the candidates themselves.  Of course I'd prefer a system where that wouldn't be an advantage, but frankly given the current system we have the "self-funded millionaire" is actually one of the few ways to get around the bigger problem of the power of entrenched incumbency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case it's rather amusing the Lieberman is a WATB about millionaire candidates even though he's supported &lt;a href="http://lamontblog.blogspot.com/2006/05/changing-his-tune-on-multimillionaires.html"&gt;them wholeheartedly in the past.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It inspired me to take a look at where Joe's support has come from in the past.  &lt;a href="http://opensecrets.org/1994os/osdata/liebejos.pdf"&gt;In his 1994 election campaign (.pdf) &lt;/a&gt; fully 87% of Lieberman's came either from PACs and from large (over $200) donations, with only 8% ($409,504) coming from individual donors giving under $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the 2000 campaign (admittedly an odd campaign due to the fact that he was also running for VP), only 4.5% of his money came from small donors ($193,562 total).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opensecrets hasn't broken out the numbers yet &lt;a href="http://opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.asp?CID=N00000616&amp;cycle=2006"&gt;for the latest campaign season.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't break out Lamonts numbers completely yet, either, but as of the latest filing he's given $371,500 of his own money to the campaign and raised $405,380 otherwise &lt;a href="http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/cancomsrs/?_06+S6CT05066"&gt;entirely from individual donations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also know from his &lt;a href="http://actblue.com/page/eschaton"&gt;total ActBlue donations&lt;/a&gt; that he's raised about half of that through that site, or $205,922, rom 4142 individual donors.  That's an average of about $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the point is WATB Joe has a history of relying on The Big Money to support his campaign, support which is generally only possible to obtain if you are the incumbent.  Ned's donated some cash himself, but it seems he's raising money from the little people much more than Joe ever did.</description>

    <description>I've long been puzzled by the obsession of right wing bloggers &lt;a href="http://alicublog.blogspot.com/2006_05_21_alicublog_archive.html#114839458812865650"&gt;with being on Google News.&lt;/a&gt;  Sure I imagine it drives a decent amount of traffic, but I find it bizarre that they'd want to go to search Google News and find a bunch of results from blogs.   I think it's great if Google includes a bunch of alternative news sources, including ideological and partisan ones, but most bloggers just don't really fit the mold.  I've never wanted to be/tried to get this blog on Google News.</description>

    <description>I haven't read Beinart's book, though I gather it makes the shocking case that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;America has and can do good in the world when it wants to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is something we should continue to do at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;A basic view of the world embraced by just about every national political figure in this country except for Pat Buchanan and George W. Bush Year 2000 Version, but I'm glad Petey's there to remind us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the real issue isn't that Petey and his fellow travelers want to tell Democrats what they should do, the real issue is that they want to be the intellectual leaders of whatever they imagine to be "liberal interventionism."  As Supreme Overlord of the Universe and Beyond &lt;a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewWeb&amp;amp;articleId=11553"&gt;Mike Tomasky&lt;/a&gt; puts it, basically, why the hell should we trust these idiots?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="summary"&gt;If we are to move forward along lines Beinart suggests, we need to know whether Beinart and other liberal hawks will recognize the difference between antitotalitarian liberalism and conservatism, neo- or otherwise, when they see it. Unfortunately, Beinart slips and slides around this question. His chapter on Iraq, which rehearses the administration’s various arguments for war, reads at first blush like a wise and disinterested account of a tragic march to folly. But he writes about this period as if he’d spent it on a mountaintop in Tibet instead of editing an influential magazine and cheering on the administration virtually every step of the way -- and accusing war critics, not all of whom (news flash: not even a &lt;i&gt;majority&lt;/i&gt; of whom) are anti-imperialist Chomskyites, of “intellectual incoherence” and “abject pacifism,” as he so unforgettably put matters to &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; in February 2003. I resented those comments at the time personally, I still do, and I know a lot of people who feel similarly.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="summary"&gt;I share many of Beinart’s goals for the Democratic Party. I’m not entirely sure how he proposes that today’s Democrats make this Niebuhrian case about recognizing America’s potential to do harm; it doesn’t seem like a vote-getter, but, intellectually at least, he’s on to something. And I found his prescriptive chapter a bit thin. His proposals for how liberals should fight the war on terrorism -- a Marshall Plan for the Arab world, greater cooperation with the United Nations (where possible), and NATO -- are rather general (and, for all his huffing and puffing about doughfacery, every one could be endorsed by the very people he reproves in the previous chapter). Even with these limitations, though, his argument that there is much wisdom to be found today in liberal foreign policy of the 1947-1963 period, and that fighting terrorism must occupy a central place in the liberal schema, is sound. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="summary"&gt;But to give this subject book-length treatment without acknowledging plainly that the war in Iraq stands against the Cold War liberal tradition rather than within it damages, almost fatally, the credibility of the argument. So we’re supposed to sign up with the author’s vision of a revived ’48-ism, even though we know from his own written record that it could lead to another Iraq? I’d love to talk with Beinart about the future and only the future. But not just yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
