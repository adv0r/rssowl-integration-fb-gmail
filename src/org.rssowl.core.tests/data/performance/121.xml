"The alcoholism doesn't come into play until later on in the story of Iron Man," he said. "[The comic] started off in the '60s, where it was about him as a successful manufacturer who developed this suit. Then, later, it spins off into that story about him fighting against himself..

		<description>The new Ghost Rider Trailer has hit the web... and I've got mixed feelings about it.  On the one hand I really like the feel of the trailer.  It's got the intensity to hook me and get me interested in the story.  But on the other hand the look of Ghost Rider in the trailer looks REALLY cartoony.  I'm mean bad bad bad.

The design of the character is fine, but he sorta stands out like a Hell's Angels version of Roger Rabbit.  Oh well, decide for yourself.

You can see the Ghost Rider trailer here.  Thanks for Jay for the heads up. Thanks to: themovieblog.com</description>

For example, setting this value to 25 means that 25% of the total bots will spawn in Team 1, and 75% in Team 2. Team 1 is always the MEC, Chinese, or their allies, while 	Team 2 is always the USA, EU, and their allies.
		Bot Difficulty: This setting determines the skill level of the bots. 10 is easiest, 100 is the most difficult. ;
	           Default Kit Selection: The kit that you used last is remembered at the beginning of the round and between maps.
