<title>X-Men 3 Reviews</title>
<link>http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/2006/05/xmen_3_reviews.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="X-Men-3" src="http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/X-Men-3.jpg" hspace="6" align="left">The early <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376994/">X-Men 3</a> reviews are starting to roll in... they're actually a little better than I was expecting.  At first everything looked like it would be disasterous, with mumblings of lack of proper budget... a rushed shooting schedule... and don't even get me started about the director fiasco.</p>

<p>Then some images and trailers started to come out, and optimism began to spring forth anew once again.  Perhaps X-Men 3 wouldn't suck as baddly as we all feared it would.  Well... it looks like that is indeed the case.</p>

<p>Here are what some critics are saying in their X-Men 3 reviews:<blockquote><b>"X-Men: The Last Stand" is a comic book movie that crams in a stunning number of characters while still managing to map out significant emotional underpinnings."</b><br />
Cole Smithey, COLESMITHEY.COM</p>

<p><b>"At least Ratner knows how to handle both action and drama on screen, even if subtlety and substance fall by the wayside."</b><br />
Rich Cline, SHADOWS ON THE WALL</p>

<p><b>"A thrilling third chapter that delves deeper thematically while expanding the universe of franchise characters. Thus far, it's simply the most X-citing film of 2006."</b><br />
David Foucher, EDGE BOSTON</p>

<p><b>"The stunts are non-stop and we marvel at them all. Yet the heart of this third film about the mutant Marvel comic characters is overtaken by splashy effects."</b><br />
Urban Cinefile Critics, URBAN CINEFILE</blockquote>As fo this moment, X-Men 3 is carrying a 63% on Rotten Tomatoes (Which is by the way 41% HIGHER than Da Vinci Code has... who on earth would have thought that a month ago?)</p>

<title>Why Does Superman Have No Memorable Super Villains?</title>
<link>http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/2006/05/why_does_superman_have_no_memorable_super_villains.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/Superman-Returns-Poster.jpg" align="left" title="" border="0" hspace="6"><b>Post submitted by: Joel Gustafsson</b> You can <a href="http://www.themovieblog.com/submit-post.html">submit a post here</a></p>

<p>Neil Gaiman & Adam Rogers talks about what makes Superman special. Why doesn't Superman have any memorable super villains? What's his desires?</p>

<p>The good folks at <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/myth.html">Wired</a> give us this: <b><blockquote>"Compared to most A-list comic characters, he has almost no memorable villains. Think of Batman, locked in eternal combat with nocturnal freaks like the Joker or Spider-Man, battling megalomaniacal weirdos like Dr. Octopus. For Superman, there's pretty much only bitter, bald Lex Luthor, forever being reinvented by writers and artists in an effort to make him a worthy foe. Superman's true enemies are disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes, jet planes tumbling from the sky, enormous meteors that would crush cities. Superman stands between humanity and a capricious universe."</blockquote></b>That is the one drawback with a character like Superman.  A character so powerful... that you just can't imagine something that could really fight him (except perhaps Doomsday).  But even if you had Doomsday fighting Superman... what could you do?  Throwing busses at eachother wouldn't do anything.  Heck... dropping MOUNTAINS on each other wouldn't do anything.  All you'd be left with is a fist fight that you can see in any other film.  It's not an easy task making Superman action sequences exciting.</p>]]></description>

<title>Heath Ledger To Play Bob Dylan?</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Heath-Ledger-Bob-Dylan" src="http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/Heath-Ledger-Bob-Dylan.jpg" hspace="6" align="left">Well, if "Ray" did so well... why not "Bob" (Ok, "Bob" isn't going to be tghe title of the movie... but I think it should be).  Looks like Heath Ledger has signed up to be the next Jamie Foxx and play Bob Dylan.</p>

<p>The good folks over at <a href="http://www.moviehole.net/news/20060524_brokeback_duo_doing_dylan.html">Moviehole</a> give us the following:<blockquote><b>Ledger has stepped in at the 11th hour to replace originally cast Colin Farrell, says Production Weekly. Directed by Todd Haynes, it&rsquo;s essentially thoughts on the life of the man, where seven characters embody a different aspect of the musician's life and work. Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Richard Gere and Julianne Moore also star. Actress (!) Charlotte Gainsburg (&#8220;21 Grams&#8221;) is also said to be playing Dylan, at one point in the film. </b></blockquote>I'm not really big on musician bio-pics in general, but I must admit that this project sound pretty creative.  Not sure how I feel about Ledger getting the role though.  Your thoughts?</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/Pitt_james.gif" title="Brad Pitt Babel" border="0" hspace="6" align="left"><b>Post submitted by: Joseph</b> You can <a href="http://www.themovieblog.com/submit-post.html">submit a post here</a></p>

<p>For those disappointed by the reviews of the first big Canne films, The Da Vinci Code and Southland Tales, this can only come as good news. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the director behind films like Amorres Perros and 21 Grams' next film Babel starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's first reviews are coming in, and it looks good, some going as far as to say it's an early candidate for the festival's top prize, the Palme d'Or. </p>

<p>>From <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/awards/cannes/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002464995">The Hollywood Reporter</a>: <b><blockquote>Tense, relentless and difficult to watch at times, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's "Babel" is an emotionally shattering drama in which a simple act of kindness leads to events that pierce our veneer of civilization and bring on the white noise of terror.</blockquote></b>Sounds good to me.</p>]]></description>

<p>The IGN boys stumbled upon an interesting story when talking to Glenn Morshower (Agent Aaron Pierce on the  show 24).</p>

<p>The good folks over at <a href="http://uk.filmforce.ign.com/articles/709/709691p1.html">Filmforce</a> give us this:<b><blockquote>'The actor hinted that he is off to New Mexico to shoot a movie with Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay. Transformers, anyone? Add Morshower to a growing cast that includes John Voight, Shia LeBouf, Michael Clarke Duncan, Bernie Mac, John Turturro and Tyrese. The actor stated that the name of the film will in fact be Prime Directive, which makes sense since Optimus Prime is the main Autobot. There is no word whether this is merely a shooting title, a subtitle (as in The Transformers: Prime Directive), or will stand alone (although that seems unlikely).<br />
</blockquote></b>Will the name survive until theatrical release? One thing to consider is that "Prime Directive" features heavily in the Star Trek mythos as well, as the abiding rule that all Starfleet officers must follow (ie: "At first, do no harm").'</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Ghost-Rider-Trailer" src="http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/Ghost-Rider-Trailer.jpg" hspace="6" align="left">The new <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/">Ghost Rider</a> Trailer has hit the web... and I've got mixed feelings about it.  On the one hand I really like the feel of the trailer.  It's got the intensity to hook me and get me interested in the story.  But on the other hand the look of Ghost Rider in the trailer looks REALLY cartoony.  I'm mean bad bad bad.</p>

<p>The design of the character is fine, but he sorta stands out like a Hell's Angels version of Roger Rabbit.  Oh well, decide for yourself.</p>

<p>You can see the <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/ghostrider/high.html">Ghost Rider trailer here</a>.  Thanks for Jay for the heads up.</p>]]></description>

It's going to be a romatic comedy (sigh) entitled "My Blueberry Nights.</p>

<p>The good folks over at <a href="http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=18835">Empire</a> give us this:<blockquote><b>And he has a cast signed up already. Singer Norah Jones, who has appeared as herself in Two Weeks Notice, will star alongside slightly more experienced types such as Jude Law, Rachel Weisz and Natalie Portman.</b></blockquote>Ok, that is quite a cast (except take Nora "I'm a singer not an actress" Jones out for heavens sake!)  It's nice to see Wai making an English film... but did it have to be a romantic comedy?!?!</p>]]></description>

<title>Underworld 3 Without Beckinsale</title>
<link>http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/2006/05/underworld_3_without_beckinsale.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/Beckinsale8.jpg" align="left" title="Kate Beckinsale not in Underworld 3" border="0" hspace="6">The correct words have not been created in the english language to properly describe just how HOT <a href="http://www.uk.imdb.com/name/nm0000295/">Kate Beckinsale</a> was in <a href="http://www.uk.imdb.com/title/tt0401855/combined">Underworld</a>.  If memory serves me correctly, several changes of pants were required during my first viewing of the film.</p>

<p>The first Underworld was ok.  Loads of potential, but it sort of lost its way a little bit.  The second Underworld was a mess pure and simple.</p>

<p><b>There IS GOING TO BE AN UNDERWORLD 3</b>.  But guess what boys and girls... no Beckinsale for this one.  The good folks over at Digital Sply give us this:<blockquote><b>The decision has come as a particular surprise since director and writer Len Wiseman is Beckinsale's husband. However, the third part to the trilogy is set to be a prequel and the part of Selena, the leather-clad character played by Beckinsale, will not be needed. The actress clarified the decision by her husband saying, "I think it's a prequel before I'm actually in it, so I think that won't include me if it happens."</b></blockquote>Well that makes sense.  I'd love to just sit and stare at Kate in that tight black leather again... but to be honest I always thought a distant prequel to the Vampire/Werewolf war would be more interesting.  So even though Underworld 2 sucked eggs... and even though there will be no Beckinsale in leather... I'm actually looking forward to Underworld 3.</p>]]></description>

I remember hearing some time about about small budget movie he had in the makings called "<a href="http://www.specialthemovie.com/">Special</a>".  Apparently the film was about a guy who starts taking some perscription medication, and then starts to believe he has Superpowers... only he doesn't.  Good  concept.</p>

<p>I finally found a trailer for the film via the good folks at <a href="http://www.cinematical.com/2006/05/22/yay-distribution-for-special/">cinimatical</a> for Special.  It is OBVIOUSLY low budget.  I only hope people can get past the inexpensive camera in order to appreciate the story telling.  We'll see.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="AMC free movies" src="http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/AMC.jpg" hspace="6" align="left">Holy crap.  Now this is a GREAT idea.  It looks like the giant movie theater chain, AMC, is going to be putting on a free movie summer project.  The good folks over at <a href="http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1165975.php/This_summer_AMC_gives_away_free_movies">M&C</a> give us this:<blockquote><b>Well, kids and adults alike can enjoy free movies and entertainment Wednesday mornings this summer thanks to AMC's "Summer MovieCamp" program. AMC Theatres will offer the community service program in 40 U.S. cities June 21, 2006, through August 9, 2006. AMC Summer MovieCamp in Charlotte, North Carolina, will run June 14, 2006, thru August 23, 2006. The box office will open at 9:30 a.m. with show times at 10:00 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. </p>

<p>AMC Summer MovieCamp 2006 will feature select titles such as: &lsquo;Racing Stripes,&rsquo; &lsquo;Ice Age,&rsquo; &lsquo;Because of Winn-Dixie,&rsquo; &lsquo;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,&rsquo; &lsquo;Dreamer,&rsquo; &lsquo;Shark Tale,&rsquo; &lsquo;Madagascar,&rsquo; &lsquo;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie,&rsquo; &lsquo;Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed,&rsquo; &lsquo;March of the Penguins,&rsquo; &lsquo;Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&rsquo;and &lsquo;Shrek 2.&rsquo;</b></blockquote>No, these aren't first run movies, but still, if I could go see March of the Penguins on a BIG screen for free I'd go (even though I already own the dvd).</p>

<p>Thumbs up to AMC for doing this little programs.  I'm not sure what they get out of it, but free movies are free movies.  You probably have to put up with 30 minutes of trailers and commercials.  Meh... who cares.</p>]]></description>

<p>Quote from FilmForce:<blockquote><b>You're planning to see X-Men: The Last Stand this  weekend, right? We expect most of you are. That being the case, apart from our regular reporting on the movie, IGN FilmForce now asks you to do one important thing. If you're an X-Men fan, you'll regret it if you don't! At the theater this weekend, when the credits roll, when the audiences begins to filter out of the exits... keep your seat. And then, perhaps, share this little secret with a few of your friends: the movie isn't over.</p>

<p>We don't want to spoil anything for you, but we want you to know that the scene that follows isn't your typical post-credits tack-on. It's a coda for one of the main characters. The scene is maybe 30 seconds in length, but it's enough. And it will surely be one of the more talked moments in the fan community.</p>

<p>Think you know what this scene is? Guess all you want, but chances are that you won't see it coming.</p>

<p>Major mutant war happens this Friday! Wolverine yells, "Hold the line!" - that stand's not easy. All you have to do is hold on through the end credits - that's much easier. You don't want miss the coda!"</b></blockquote>So there you have it folks.  If you go see X-Men 3, STAY IN YOUR SEATS when the credits roll.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Charels-Eric" src="http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/Charels-Eric.jpg" hspace="6" align="left">A new clip from X-Men 3 has been posted up on <a href="http://www.trailerplayer.com/XMen_GuardianFilm_clip7_snif.html">Film Guardian</a>.  It's a dandy!  no, not lots of action of special effects in this one.  It's a simple clip of Eric and Charles (Magneto and Professor X) going to see Jean as an adult in her childhood home.</p>

<p>There is some great tension in the scene, and it also sort of encapsulates the dynamics between Eric and Charles too.  To <a href="http://www.trailerplayer.com/XMen_GuardianFilm_clip7_snif.html">see the new X-Men 3 clip you can just go here</a>.  Thanks to Alan for the heads up.</p>]]></description>

<title>Angels and Demons Movie To Follow Da Vinci</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Angels-And-Demons" src="http://www.themovieblog.com/archives/Angels-And-Demons.jpg" hspace="6" align="left">One of the unshakable truths in Hollywood is that no matter how poor a movie is, if it makes money the studio will make a sequel.  True, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743486226/102-0668890-4874555?n=283155">Angels and Demons</a> isn't a sequel to Da Vinci (it's Browns third book, Da Vinci is his fourth), but it's the same thing.</p>

<p>So on the heals of the #13 largest opening weekend in history (ironically just behind Passion of the Christ at #12) with $77 million domestically, Sony is rushing to announce that they are indeed going to start work on Angels and Demons.  Haven't heard of it?  Neither have most people, but here's a synopsis from <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,23569-2191119.html">The Times</a>:<blockquote><b>Angels and Demons was the reclusive author&rsquo;s third novel after he gave up his job as an English teacher. It tells the story of Langdon&rsquo;s brush with a shadowy secret society, the Illuminati, and his frantic quest for the world&rsquo;s most powerful energy source, in the company of a beautiful Italian physicist whose father, a brilliant physicist, has been murdered.</b></blockquote>Sound familiar?  It should.  Because now read the synopsis for Da Vinci:<blockquote><b>The formula may sound familiar to fans of The Da Vinci Code, his fourth book, which has become a publishing phenomenon, selling more than 45 million copies. It concerns Langdon&rsquo;s brush with a shadowy secret society, Opus Dei, and his frantic quest for the Holy Grail in the company of a beautiful French cryptologist whose grandfather, the Louvre&rsquo;s curator, has been murdered.</b></blockquote>Hehehe</p>

<p>Am I looking forward to Angels and Demons?  Nope.  But Sony would be morons not to make a follow up film with that kind of money on the line.  Thanks to James for the heads up.</p>]]></description>
