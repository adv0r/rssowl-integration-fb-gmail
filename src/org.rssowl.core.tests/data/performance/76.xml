        <title>New Article: Performance Analysis Made Simple Using SPOT</title>
        <link>http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/cc/articles/spot.html?feed=DSC</link>
        <description>An application's performance depends on a combination of hardware and software factors. There are a number of tools that can be used to extract information or collect this kind of information, but knowing which tools to pick can be tricky. This paper introduces a new tool that aims to simplify the process of performance analysis. Called the Simple Performance Optimisation Tool, SPOT is an add-on package to Sun Studio 11 for UltraSPARC based systems. Spot is part of the Cool Tools project. </description>

        <title>New Article: Using VIS Instructions To Speed Up Applications</title>
        <link>http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/cc/articles/vis.html?feed=DSC</link>
        <description>The advantage of using VIS instructions is that an operation can be applied to different items of data in parallel; meaning that it takes the same time to compute eight 1 byte results as it does to calculate one 8-byte results. In theory this means that code that uses VIS instructions can be many times faster than code without them</description>
