        <p>Hmm, much as I love Valleywag, there's some factual inaccuracies in the <a href="http://www.valleywag.com/tech/anil-dash/from-the-vault-six-apart-vp-spammed-for-a-job-175895.php">loving tribute</a> posted about me today. It asserts that a Vault.com story says that I was trying to spam people with my resume when I was out of work before <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2003/04/23/i_work_for_six_">joining Six Apart</a>.</p>

<p>But, if you refer to my <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2001/05/16/yeah_well_when_">note at the time</a>, you can see the story's actually from <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2001/01/31/i_didnt_lose_my">early 2001</a>, well before Six Apart or even Movable Type existed.</p>

<p>The context is kind of important, since this was right after the (first?) dot-com bubble burst and it was a rough time to be in technology in <span class="caps">NYC.</span> But a few lean months later I got my job at the <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/">Voice</a> and all was well.</p>

<p>As I said in the comments on Valleywag, you're <em>goddamn right</em> I was emailing every person I could about finding a good job. I was also blogging like crazy, writing some of my best stuff. And I was trying to go out and meet new people too, since I really didn't know anybody in the industry. Those tactics might seem old-fashioned now that every kid with a PowerBook thinks he can make something to flip to Yahoo, but I still think they're a good idea if you want to establish yourself. It's only five years later and some anonymous somebody is spending his time searching for my name on Vault instead of finding a better job. There's a lot more I'd like to accomplish before I'd consider myself a success, but I take no small satisfaction in having gone from nowhere to somewhere over the past five years.</p>

        <p>These days, I think people in traditional media outlets are writing stories just so they'll get linked on particular blogs.</p>

<p>John Cook <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2141421/">trumping up a fuss</a> in Slate about <a href="http://www.sashafrerejones.com/">Sasha</a> and <a href="http://tiny.abstractdynamics.org/">Jessica's</a> analysis of Merritt-ocracy seems like it was written <em>just so</em> <a href="http://www.hiphopmusic.com/">Jay</a> would maybe write a post about it.</p>

<p>The Times' <span class="caps">A.O.</span> Scott seems to have written his <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/2006/05/18/movies/18code.html">lengthy, amusing slam</a> of <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> just so <a href="http://www.defectiveyeti.com/">Matthew</a> could cover it in the <a href="http://www.defectiveyeti.com/archives/cat_bad_review_revue.html">Bad Review Revue</a>.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/business/yourmoney/14michael.html?ei=5088&amp;en=ca1b4c7af43b7dc0&amp;ex=1305259200&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">three thousand eight hundred words about Michael Jackson's finances</a>?

        <p>One of those interesting side-effects of having lots of old blog posts around is that sometimes they come back to life. With <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060514/ap_en_mu/dj_arrested_16">Star being fired</a> last week, there's been a whole bunch of new visitors and commenters to my old post which states, correctly, that <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/01/12/star_and_bucwil">Star and Bucwild can kiss my ass</a>.</p>

<p>And since, naturally, their <a href="http://www.starandbucwild.com/">own site</a> offers no content <em>and</em> no place for people to have a discussion, it seems like the only forum for the conversation is blogs like mine, even though my site isn't really about these clowns at all.</p>

<p>At any rate, I'm certainly not sad to see this no-talent get fired, but I do think it's always interesting that individual blog posts can essentially become mini-sites, where conversations go on forever. I'd seen that in the past with my own post about <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2003/01/20/diamonds_are_fo">diamonds</a>, and on other people's blogs in examples such as <a href="http://www.kottke.org/03/06/own-conversation">Jason's post about <em>The Matrix Reloaded</em></a>. Now I'm curious to see the next conversation that wanders onto my old posts.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you play <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000EGELP0/2020-20">Brain Age</a>, you need to help <a href="http://www.dropcash.com/campaign/anildash/buy_dr_kawashima_some_fucking/">buy Dr. Kawashima some fucking allergy medicine</a>. Am I right? If you're not playing Brain Age, you need to get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00064MUIA/2020-20">DS</a> and get with the program. It's like <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/03/08/housekeeping_no">brain hacks</a> in a box.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li>Why should you trust me about video games? Because even Forbes magazine knows <a href="http://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/03/09/nintendo-ds-review_cx_rr_0309toybox.html" title="read the article for a creepy mention of pedophiles">I am an expert</a> on toys that are designed for six-year-old Japanese girls.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.allaboutgeorge.com/">George</a> sent word of <a href="http://www.thefader.com/blog/articles/2006/04/20/uptown-showdown-in-paisley-park">two new Prince-themed mixtapes</a> mentioned over on Fader. I should get around to listening to and reviewing those... well, probably not any time soon.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li>Writing about music makes me miss when I used to do more of that on my different blogs. Like the <a href="http://www.anildash.com/poplife/2003/09/justin_timberla.html">time I saw Justin Timberlake live</a> a couple years ago. Yeah, go ahead and laugh -- I had fun that night and your broke ass was sitting home and you know it.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li>Was nice of the 37signals crew to note that <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/fly_on_the_wall_im_running_into_a_problem_with_humantime.php">I'd contributed an idea</a> on the Basecamp logo. I'd forgotten about that conversation, but the other thing I liked about the little mountain is it looked kind of like a chart showing an upward trend over time. Neat.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.knittaplease.com/">Knitta, <em>Please</em></a>.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li>I'm officially as tired of Web 2.0 jokes and backlash as I am of Web 2.0, but I'll make an exception for the <a href="http://cheese.blartwendo.com/web21-demo.html">fully-functional server-side blink tag demo</a>. It's a <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">DailyWTF</a> come to life.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li>Sometimes people ask how I can stand going out and trying to leave comments on half the blogs in the blogosphere every day, especially when people sometimes just like to bitch for the sake of bitching. Well, the answer to how I can do it is because <a href="http://sonspring.com/journal/sixapology">sometimes people are amazingly thoughtful and kind</a>. I told you <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/12/16/its_good_to_ha">it's good to have friends</a>.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li>The digg blog's post on <a href="http://diggtheblog.blogspot.com/2006/03/ads-on-digg.html">ads on digg</a> was the best thing I've seen since Brad's <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/lj_biz/236361.html">explanation of why people can choose to have ads on their LiveJournals now</a>. It's not merely that they're explaining the benefits well; It's more that you can see a thoughtful person in the process of evolving their thinking on the utility of marketing or advertising in our culture. As a recovering Adbuster-zealot type myself, I like anybody who embraces moderation instead of extremism. Really, I feel that way about almost everything.</li>

        <p>I have this theory about a radical improvement in user experience that could be made for any website that allows comments to be submitted by readers. Especially if any of those readers are male. I'd like to share this idea with you.</p>

<p>You see, I know a lot of people that make community applications or blogging tools; I even get to work with some of the best in the business. I'm sure they do fancy things like eye-tracking and usability tests and armies of robots analyzing comment forms. But there's still one behavior that's eluded them, even after years of experience.</p>

<p>Based on extensive observation in the nearly 7 years that I've been blogging, here is how men actually submit comments to a site:</p>


<ol>
<li>Skim <em>just</em> enough of the first few sentences so you can get a fair idea what the topic of a post or news item is.</li>
<li>Scroll quickly, as fast as you can! Be careful not to accidentally read any of the other comments on the page on the way down. (Some of them may contain the information you're about to post.)</li>
<li>Type out whatever opinion you've had on this topic your entire life. Don't waste time with spelling or punctuation, and be careful not to let any new information on the page influence your thoughts.</li>
<li>Now that you've completed your task, submit your comment and then, at your leisure, review the other content on the page. If you find that the original post or any of the comments that preceded yours were written by people who share your opinion, bask in the confirmation that <em>you were right</em>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Now the time has clearly come for modern Web 2.0 applications to reflect this reality. Where is all the innovation around accommodating this unquenchable need? We men <em>need</em> to inflict our comments on the web with wanton disregard for the context, content, and community in which we're participating.

        <p><img alt="Daniel Henninger has never been proven to eat people" src="http://www.dashes.com/anil/daniel-henninger.jpg" width="320" height="172" style="float : left; padding : 10px;" />
Mr. Henninger, I had the good fortune to review <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/dhenninger/?id=110008265">your column</a>, in which you express, at length and in some detail, your extreme distaste for people publishing their own opinions on the Internet. I wanted to let you know that I am glad that you have published your own opinion on this matter. On the Internet.</p>

<p>Also, you ask, "At the risk of enabling, does the Internet mean that all the rest of us are being made unwitting participants in the personal and political life of, um, crazy people?" Your example aside, I think not. I fear you are the exception to the rule, though if I could ask your indulgence in reviewing some of my own <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/05/24/behold_intelle">past crazy ramblings</a>, you might understand that I <em>truly</em> appreciate the intellectual dishonesty you exhibit when you mention that you "don't think the blogosphere is breeding cannibals. But..." How could you lower the legendarily high standards of the Wall Street Journal's editorial page by making such an accusation without factual evidence to back it up?</p>

<p>The truth is, <strong>it is still an open question</strong> whether the growth of cannibalism around the world is due to the blogosphere, or whether this growth is in fact due to instant messaging. Let's get some fact-checkers on this!</p>

<p>Referring to the growing trend towards "uninhibited speech", you lament, "On the Web and on the street, more people than not talk like this now." Truly, these outbreaks of free speech are a scourge and a disappointment. Your examples of this reckless tendency for people, even poor or uneducated ones, to say whatever they want serve an important purpose. The litany of transgressions helps call attention to how these cannibals-in-training are inflicting their "thoughts" on anyone without filtering, or indeed, without even <em>asking</em> you.</p>

<p>It's almost as if free expression for people who aren't editors at newspapers is a gateway to the consumption of human flesh, just as access to the postal service is a gateway to incest and bigamy. And who are the people treading this dangerous path of expressing themselves? It's not just young people on the Internet; It's exactly those whom you'd expect to hasten the end of civilization and our inexorable descent into savagery:</p>


<ul>
<li>Hip hop artists</li>
<li>Actors on the Sopranos (curse that <span class="caps">HBO</span>!)</li>
<li>Construction workers</li>
<li>People who go to bars</li>
</ul>



<p>And also, people who comment on the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/">Huffington Post</a>.</p>

<p>Most importantly, you've pointed out "the isolation of Web life" and the serious implications of unfettered communications. Indeed, those who would claim that bloggers, or even those who merely use email, are communicating with "other people" on the Internet have a grave misunderstanding of the medium. Unlike your own efforts to publish your opinions on the web, when any average people, or even a mere construction worker, publish our thoughts on the Internet, we have only one goal in reaching other people.</p>

<p><strong>We want to eat them.</strong></p>

        <p>One of my recurrent sources of frustration with my fellow geeks is that most are just plain <em>lousy</em> at convincing others to try technologies. It's only because the stuff geeks make is so flat-out valuable that anybody else ever even gives it a try. Seriously: Stop naming things with clever acronyms and waiting for people to get the joke.</p>

<p>So I've tried to do the right thing and start sharing what I've learned. Thus, "<a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/news/2006/04/scary_as_hell.html">How to keep blogs from scaring the hell out of people</a>" I'm no great coder, I'm a lousy designer, but one thing I am good at is trying to help regular people see the value of different kinds of technologies.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I'm tempted to do a lot more evil as well. I keep thinking about the fact that, basically, some bloggers will believe <em>anything</em>, at least for long enough to post it on the web. Then, of course, things devolve into the usual finger-pointing and ass-fact-checking and all that kind of stupidity. There's still that little window of time, though, when you can get the credulous to write about or link to just about anything.</p>

<p>What I think we should do is start a kind of anti-<a href="http://www.snopes.com/">Snopes</a>. A place to store confirmation of any piece of bad information, with some really reassuring tones that the random alarmist, xenophobic, improbable assertion that's found its way into your inbox is <em>absolutely true</em>. Kind of the dark opposite of <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2001/08/22/pardon_me_for_b">Pardon me for being forward</a>.</p>

<p>And judging by all the ads on Snopes, there's probably a lot of money in it. It's like Fox News, only we acknowledge our intellectual dishonesty.</p>

        <p>Last month, I wrote a <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/03/05/reinventing_cop">bit about Copy and Paste</a>, the history of technologies like rich content embedding, and how this stuff will evolve in the world of Ajax applications. The next day, Microsoft <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/rayozzie/blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry">announced</a> <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/editorial/rayozzie/demo/liveclip/liveclipsample/clipboardexample.html">Live Clipboard</a>, which was followed shortly by a <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/editorial/rayozzie/demo/liveclip/specification/v091.html">draft spec</a>. There was also some interesting feedback on my post from <a href="http://digg.com/design/Reinventing_Copy_and_Paste">Digg</a>.</p>

<p>Now it seems like there's some even stronger advances, which I'm super excited to see. The brillian team at Zimbra has just blogged about <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/blog/archives/2006/04/zimbra_ale-ajax_linking_and_embedding.html"><span class="caps">ALE </span>- Ajax Linking and Embedding</a>. The key points:</p>

<blockquote><span class="caps">AJAX</span> Linking and Embedding (ALE) provides the ability to embed rich content into an editable document and to then interact with and edit that content in much the same way as it is done with traditional office suites and applications in a desktop environment. A key difference is that instead of embedding objects that are backed by installed desktop applications (e.g. a spreadsheet or drawing application), within the <span class="caps">ALE </span>world the embedded objects are <span class="caps">AJAX </span>components that are embedded into an editable <span class="caps">HTML </span>document. These components adhere to a set of design patterns specified by the <span class="caps">ALE </span>specification.</blockquote>

<p>Sweet! Now, I realize it makes me a super-nerd to be excited about this stuff, but <em>someone</em> has to be. There's a demo spec up already, I'm curious to see if anybody else will implement this and test out the possibilties for interop.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Jon Udell's <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/04/03.html">screencast on Live Clipboard</a> is a great resource to check out if you're interested in this stuff.</p>

        <p>Hey, there! I'm your friend, so I didn't want to be the one to tell you. But someone had to: Your April Fool's Day joke sucks.</p>

<p>Really, it does. April Fool's works really well if you're either genuinely funny or if you make something that's plausible enough to actually trick someone for a while. "Just do something stupid" need not apply. And it's especially hard to be appropriately clever on the web.</p>

<p>Now, I know with my old-fashioned outdated ideas of humor I sound like one of those prescriptive grammarians gnashing their teeth over Alanis' use of the word "ironic". And, friend, let me tell you: Sometimes, I <em>am</em> the kind of curmudgeon that makes Andy Rooney look like Jessica Simpson. But that, today, is not my motivation.</p>

<p>No, it's that I'm trying to help you raise the bar. Thus, a list of things which do not actually constitue a valid April Fools' Day joke:</p>


<ul>
<li>"I changed my stylesheet! To someone else's!" Why isn't that funny? Because I <em>still knew it was your site</em>.</li>
<li>"Our tiny company bought/got bought by a giant company. Like Microsoft!" Wow, that's lame. Neither believable nor surprising enough to be amusing.</li>
<li>"We are embracing this thing we've demonized forever!" So you're a pest removal service that's getting into the cockroach-raising business? Sigh.</li>
<li>"We have a big announcement today!" No you don't. It's Saturday.</li>
<li>"Our new product does the impossible." You mean like making an April Fool's joke on the web that's actually <em>funny</em>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Anyway, enough bitching. Let's see if we've helped scuttle any bad ideas that were about to be inflicted on us. Happy April Fool's!</p>

        <p>From the New York Times' Sunday Styles section <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/fashion/sundaystyles/12silicon.html">Silicon Alley's resurgence</a>, pegged to a tech Meetup where the crowd was discussing new web startups. Yep, Web 2.0 is hitting the East Coast, though apparently not all of the startups are as interesting as del.icio.us or, well, Meetup itself. Fortunately, people aren't afraid to criticize things in New York, and <a href="http://www.fotolog.com/heif">Scott</a> reveals his prescience:</p>

<blockquote>
He began by asking his tech-savvy listeners simplistic questions about their knowledge of the Web.

<p>"You're going to get booed off before you start," shouted Scott Heiferman, a founder of the social networking company Meetup and the organizer of the Tech Meetup.</p>

<p>Prescient words, it turned out. Mr. Robertson faced a barrage of withering questions and eventually slunk offstage to mocking laughter from the audience.</p>

"I got ambushed," he said afterward. "I didn't know it was a 'Gong Show' thing."<br />
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the tone, especially in this context, was a bit unkind. But that sense that, sometimes at least, ideas <em>just suck</em> is exactly what I was lamenting in <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/02/03/alt_weeklies_s">my post</a> a few weeks ago. "A complete unwillingness to be critical, an almost astoundingly low set of criteria for acceptance -- these aren't the traits that encourage a community or a culture to improve."</p>

<p>So, to everybody looking for the flip-to-Yahoo-cuz-we've-got-tags Next Big Thing, find a room with a tough crowd. Pitch your idea. See if you get booed. And if you're in the Bay Area? Start being more judicious with the applause.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I see things and assume that either someone has the same sick sense of humor that I do, or else people have completely lost their sense of the absurd. From the sidebar on <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/03/11/mob.ports.ap/index.html">this <span class="caps">CNN </span>news story</a> today comes the following poll:</p>

<form target="popuppoll" method="post" action="http://polls.cnn.com/poll" style="padding : 20px;">
<input name="poll_id" value="23733" type="hidden">
<h3>Who would you rather have overseeing operations at <span class="caps">U.S. </span>ports?</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type : none;">
<li>Arab-based ports company <input value="1" name="question_1" type="radio"></li>
<li><span class="caps">U.S.</span>-based mafia <input value="2" name="question_1" type="radio"></li>
</ul>
<input  value="Vote" type="submit">
</form>

<p>Whoa, seriously? Somebody went to j-school for <em>that</em>? I am certain that your mother must be proud you're the guy who put that on <span class="caps">CNN.</span>com. ($10 via PayPal to the first person who can get me a definitive answer about who's responsible for this lunacy.)</p>

<p>And two thirds of people who voted are in favor of <em>known criminals</em> running our ports? (Technically, it's only 64% of the 55880 votes cast so far, but that's still amazing.) Jon Stewart is clearly being overpaid, because some anonymous web wizard at <span class="caps">CNN </span>is a <em>lot</em> funnier than anything Comedy Central has conjured up.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.cnn.com/POLLSERVER/results/23733.exclude.html">the results</a> for yourself, or just cast your own vote to see what everyone else thinks. </p>
