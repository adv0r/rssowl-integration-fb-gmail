      <description><![CDATA[<ul><li><p>Greetings to anyone who found my blog by reading last week's issue of The Advocate.  Uhm, sorry for being on hiatus.  This is probably the second or third time I've been in a magazine like this, but I always find it kinda surreal to walk into a bookstore, turn to a particular page and BAM!  There I am, headshot staring back at me.  It's especially fun when they interview a bunch of gay bloggers, and I'm the only blogger featured that isn't a buffed-out white boy or Margaret Cho.  (I swear, if there's ever another opportunity to have my photo in a magazine like that, I'm just going to wear a giant yellow shirt that says "TOKEN.")</p>

<p>And because I'm keeping my end of the bargain:  <a href="http://www.squeakytoy.net">Steven</a> took my photograph for the magazine, therefore you should go visit his blog.  Incidentally, that photograph of me was taken at the top floor of a parking garage in downtown San Jose, which made for a nice little conversation driving downtown.</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Steven:</b>  Wow, there sure are a ton of people by the convention center.<br />
<b>Ernie:</b> Yeah, seriously.  What do you think they're all here for?<br />
<b>Steven:</b>  (makes a face)  Eeeew, from the looks of them?  <i>Bacon</i>.
<p>(Ernie and Steven drive another block, where they come across a giant banner that says "WELCOME, NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS MEMBERS."  Ernie throws Steve a glance.)</p>
<b>Steven:</b> What?
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>I've been hesitant of divulging this information until I'm 100% sure, but I figure I can say something now:  I'll be moving from the family friendly suburbs of Fremont to heathen-filled San Francisco, sometime in mid to late June.  It'll only be for a couple of months while I finish my friend's lease out, but I figure that it'll be enough time for me to have a cultural breather, some much needed social interaction and an appreciation for MUNI drivers high on drugs.  Maybe it'll get me out of this rut.  Maybe.</p></li>

<p><li>Oh yeah, and my dad is moving in my condo in the next week or two. </p></li>

      <title>the only asian insurance guy in tennessee (hiatus)</title>
      <link>http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/?z=post&amp;y=archives/003404</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It's gotten pretty obvious that I've been avoiding in this blog lately.  White Elephant: 1, Ernie: 0.</p>

<p>To be honest, I'm at a point of my life where I've cornered myself into a life rut.  A couple of weeks ago, my father sat me down at a Fresh Choice, and matter-of-factly gave me a bullet points of things I should - no, must - do when my parents pass away, all of which involve living wills and taking care of Angela and being her legal, protective guardian, even though I'm ten years younger than her.</p>

<p>I agree to it.  Why?  Because I have to, that's why.</p>

<p>There's more to this story, but I'm no longer comfortable in talking about it due to certain people who read this blog.  Hence the blog avoiding, I guess.</p>

<p>This is the year most of my friends from college and I turn 30.  Already, I've been through at least four 30th birthday parties, with a couple more to go.  I'll attend at least two wedding ceremonies this year, and one of my good friends is expecting their first child.  And while I love my friends to death, they all have their lives to lead and families to raise and they're settling down.  God knows I'm settling down too, but I'm, uhm, settling down in a way I didn't want to settle down.</p>

<p>Does that make any sense at all?  Didn't think so.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of weeks, I've been trying to write something - anything at all - on LYD, and I've come up with nothing.  Nothing humorous, because honestly, nothing that zany or interesting has really happened.  I go to work, I come home, I deal with my parents, they unload their problems with me and I chain-smoke on the car ride home.  Lather, rinse, repeat, and sometimes I hang with friends at night or on the weekends, to keep me from waking up, packing all my belongs and driving to, say, Nashville where I would begin a new life as, I don't know, an insurance broker.  The only Asian insurance guy in Tennessee.  Not to say I haven't been tempted lately.</p>

<p>And I guess this is a reason why now would be a good time to put a hiatus on this blog, at least in terms of the journal-like format I currently have at this moment.   Don't delete your RSS feeds yet, because I DO have some plans that may or may not come to fruition over the next couple of months, and you never know what could happen.  But something has gotta give, or change.</p>

<p>I just don't know what it'll be yet.</p>]]></description>

      <title>the cruise</title>
      <link>http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/?z=post&amp;y=archives/003374</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ernie/96102980/" title="Photo Sharing" style="float:right;"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/36/96102980_3bd7baa146_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" style="border:1px solid black;" alt="eric and i suddenly realize we could drown to our peril" /></a>
<p>I never did post about my cruise, did I?  Very well, then.  A couple of weeks ago, I went on a 7-day cruise to Mexico with <a title="bitch has a wikipedia entry" href="http://www.emotioneric.com">Emotion Eric</a>.  The idea started innocently enough:</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Eric:</b>  Cruises are great.  You can eat any time you want, and you don't have to pay a cashier afterwards.<br />
<b>Ernie:</b>  Dude, I wanna eat.  I've never gone before.  <br />
<b>Eric:</b>  You wanna go?<br />
<b>Ernie:</b>  Sure.<br />
<b>Eric:</b>  Okay, I'll book the tickets.
</blockquote>

<p>And the next thing you know, I was on a boat drinking a mango tango with a Jamaican band playing "Who Let the Dogs Out."  I had never done the whole cruise ship experience, had never rolled my eyes at the cheesy cruise ship musical shows, ridden a horse, snorkeled or kayaked.  And now that I'm approaching 30, I figure I can cross off "been on a cruise" on my to-do list for "Things to do now that I'm adult and have to do adult things."</p>

<p>Some other thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Going with Eric (who is straight) was cool, but I feel kinda bad for him, because apparently the conversation with co-workers afterwards went something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Co-worker:</b>  So I heard you went on a cruise with Ernie.<br />
<b>Eric:</b>  Yep.<br />
<b>Co-worker:</b>  Isn't he...?<br />
<b>Eric:</b>  Yep.<br />
<b>Co-worker:</b> ... niiiiiice.<br />
<b>Eric:</b>  <i>*rolls eyes*</i>
</blockquote>

<p>To which I will say to my co-workers publically:  Chill.  Jeezus, you guys, it's just two friends going on a giant boat to Mexico.  I mean,  how gay is going on a cruise line, going horseback riding on the beach, walking along the coastline of Puerto Vallarta at sunset?  With the waves, crashing in slow motion on the beach, drinks with little umbrellas in hand?  Totally not gay at all.</p>

<p>Okay, it <i>is</i> pretty gay.  Talk all the shit you want.  Seriously.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ernie/96103617/" title="Photo Sharing" style="margin-left:5px;float:right;"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/24/96103617_56ca87dc86_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="chinese brokeback mountain" style="border:1px solid #000;" /></a><p>Speaking of gay:  it seems like every single gay blogger seems to be making reference to Brokeback Mountain.  Heath Ledger shirtless in a magazine!  Jake Whatshisface in a magazine!  They're in cowboy hats and making out!  That's like a porno, but it's not, because it's artsy!  So, just to be one of the status quo, here's a picture of Eric and I on horses.  Please send me donations, kthxbi.</p></li>

<li><p>The stuff of cruise boats pride themselves of being an international staff and trying to make you feel as welcome as possible and trying to speak in your native language.  Eric and I are both ethnically Chinese.  Hilarity ensues.</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Wait staff,</b> to the both of us:  NI HAO!!<br />
<b>Us, in unison:</b>  Ni hao.<br />
<b>Deck hands:</b>  NI HAO!!<br />
<b>Us, in unison:</b>  Uhh... ni hao.<br />
<b>Mexican street kids selling chiclets:</b>  NI HAO!!<br />
<b>Ernie:</b>  <i>(to Eric)</i>  Okay, this is getting hella old.  We should speak in Chinese so they'll start ignoring us.  "Women bu tingdong." [<i>"We don't understand."</i>]<br />
<b>Eric:</b>  DUDE, <b>HELLA</b> BU TINGDONG!<br />
<b>Ernie:</b>  Nice.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Because of the time of year and the length of the cruise, there are a lot of senior citizens.  A LOT of senior citizens.  I have NEVER danced with so many older women in my entire life.  (And by older I mean 60, by "never so much" I mean three, and by "danced" I mean "politely sway side by side while AC/DC was being played by some 19 year old German intern on a cruise boat for college credits.)  </p></li>

<li><p>You know how you play Bingo on a cruise?  Oh, we played bingo, alright.  I can proudly say that I know most of the bingo variations:  lucky 7, corners, black-out.  Apparently, older people play bingo the same way packs of teenagers will stare each other down at the shopping mall; they'll <i>cut</i> you if you fuck with them.</p></li>

<li><p>Funniest conversation I've had on the trip:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Ernie:</b>  <i>(sarcastically, because he's having a hard time falling asleep)</i> Eric, sing me a lullaby.<br />
<b>Eric:</b>  Uhmm... okay.
<p>
"Hush little baby,"<br />
"don't you cry..."<br />
"uhm... Mama's gonna bake you"<br />
"uh... a pumpkin pie."
</p>
<p>
"And if that... pumpkin pie don't... uhm... sing..."<br />
"Mama's gonna make you... uhh... eat... her... thing..."
</p>
<b>Ernie:</b>  <i>(eyes open in horror)</i>
</blockquote>

      <title>the ungayest gay whose ever gayed</title>
      <link>http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/?z=post&amp;y=archives/003342</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Here are a list of reasons why you should NOT vote for me for best gay blogger for the <a href="http://2006.bloggies.com/">2006 Bloggies</a>.  I would create a PowerPoint presentation, if I could.  I work for a major corporation, don't think that it didn't cross my mind.</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>Because I won this award three times already.  Three frickin' times, over the past four years.  <a href="http://2002.bloggies.com/">One year as a consolation prize</a> because Wesley Crusher from Star Trek isn't a homosexual.</p></li>  
   
   <li><p>Here's what happens when you win a Bloggie, LGBT divison:  if you're fortunate enough, you get to attend the South By Southwest Festival in Austin, where <a title="photo via seyd, one of the 5% of homos that WAS at the bloggies" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/seyd/6639003/">you're asked to participate in the Bloggies awards ceremony</a>.  This usually consists of standing on a stage in front of a giant screen that's has IRC running, while dozens of IRC trolls make fun of you, literally, behind your back.  When you win, there is polite applause (since 95% of all attendees are heterosexual anyway) and you're given a piece of cardstock that basically says, "Congratulations!  You're the GAYEST BLOGGER EVAR!!1!"  (Although I did also receive a rainbow chain necklace and an inverted Burger King cardboard crown one year.  That was pretty nice.)</p>
   
   <p>And it's all fairly ironic, because while I'm gay, I don't think of myself as <i>that</i> gay - you can't really be gay when you have a condo in the suburbs, in the Silicon Valley, no less.  What, am I going to bump house music while the Indian neighbors light firecrackers when it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divali">Divali</a>?  They're scared of me <i>enough</i>.  (Actually... that's not half a bad idea.  Hrm.)</p></li>

   <li><p>Because there are better blogs that deserve to win.  The co-nominies, <a href="http://towleroad.typepad.com">Towleroad</a>, <a href="http://www.queerty.com/">Queerty</a> and <a href="http://www.goodasyou.org/">Good As You</a> are solid, but my personal favorite is a <a href="http://joemygod.blogspot.com">Joe. My. God.</a>, a blog I've been reading for a while and has one of the funniest blog posts EVER in <a href="http://joemygod.blogspot.com/2005/01/gay-gayer-gayest.html">Gay, Gayer, Gayest</a>.  I'm all for a good storyteller, and trust me, Joe is definately a good storyteller.  Also, his blog is the only other blog that doesn't contain ads for gay nude resorts or laser hair removal.  I'm just saying.</p></li>
   
   <li><p>Andy Towle, the guy at Towleroad, <a href="http://towleroad.typepad.com/towleroad/2005/10/support_towlero.html">sells t-shirts of his website for $25</a> <a href="http://towleroad.typepad.com/towleroad/2006/01/id_like_to_take.html">and has galleries of Brazillian models wearing them</a>.  Therefore, Towleroad wins, hands down.  If I made LYD t-shirts, sold them for half the price and begged people to take pictures of themselves wearing them, I would have a who's who of Slashdot readers, midwestern housewives and a closeted married rice queen from New Hampshire.  Maybe a furry or two.</p></li>

      <title>christmas 2005 (part 2)</title>
      <link>http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/?z=post&amp;y=archives/003336</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I never did talk about Christmas with my Mom and my sister, did I?  Very well, then.</p>

<p>So every Christmas, I take my mom out to a Chinese restaurant.  This should surprise absolutely no one, since the Chinese shopping centers treat Christmas like any other day of the year except for the giant Christmas tree smack dab in front of the Ranch 99.  I like to think of the Christmas tree as a sign of goodwill from the management; in reality, it's probably more of a blatant reminder to the employees that while white people everywhere are spending time with their families, they're busy stocking shelves, steaming pork buns or selling body parts of endangered species.</p>

<p>This year though, my mother wanted something different.</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Ernie:</b> <i>So where do you want to eat this year, Ma?</i><br>
<b>Mom:</b> <i>... this year, I want American food.</i><br>
<b>Ernie:</b> [cue sound of record scratching]  Really?<br>
<b>Mom:</b>  <i>But nothing too expensive.  I don't want you to spend too much money on me, after all.</i><br>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, my mother's version of "Fancy American Dining" is usually Hometown Buffet; the idea of all-you-can-eat spare ribs and crab legs is the ultimate American decadence to her, along with the Home Shopping Network.  (She LOVES her those damn cubic zirconium rings, but that's another blog post entirely.)  Unfortunately for me, Hometown Buffet is closed on Christmas Day, which leaves two options:  Denny's or an uber-fancy restaurant.</p>

<p>I briefly close my eyes and try to imagine us eating Christmas dinner at Denny's.  Then I remind myself that the last time I was at Denny's, it was three in the morning and I witnessed one of the servers start a physical altercation with the short order cook.  I then imagine my sister, losing her temper and attacking both of them with a serrated butter knife.  </p>

<p>Well, that won't do.</p>

<p>So instead, I took them to Parcel 104, a fancy restaurant that serves "Californian Cuisine."  Now, I've never taken both my mother and my sister out to anything this extravagant before, so I'm a little nervous;  I remind them to wear something nice beforehand - NO SWEAT PANTS - and when I show up to the house to take them to the restaurant, my mother is wearing a delightful red sweater, red slacks, and has a red silk scarf around her neck.  My sister is wearing the same sweater and scarf combination, but in green.  Like they were stewardess for "Crazy Chinese Family Airlines," now departing for a fancy American restaurant.</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Mom:</b>  Ernie, <i>your face and neck are going to be cold.  Here, I made a scarf a couple of years ago than you can wear, so you can be warm.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>The scarf is made out of silk.  It has blue flowers on it.</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Ernie:</b>  No.<br>
<b>Mom:</b>  <i>What's wrong with it?  Blue is a masculine color.</i>  FOR BOYS!<br>
<b>Ernie:</b>  NO, NO, A THOUSAND TIMES NO.<br>
<b>Mom:</b> (mocking) Wah.  THOUSAND NO.  Ai-ya.
</blockquote>

<p>Once we actually got seated inside the restaurant, the experience went by relatively smoothly.  Instead of writing about the actual dining experience itself, I'll just highlight the experience in little bullet points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>My mother and sister eats salads and entrees the same way they eat a bowl of ramen:  hover over the bowl or plate, shovel everything you can into your mouth, bite off the rest, continue process until food is eaten.  Salad fork?  Knife?  Fuck that, we're going for efficiency.  I nodded and smiled politely to our waitress and fellow patrons as they did their best to convince themselves that table etiquette isn't <i>really</i> necessary on Christmas day.</p></li>

<li><p>Mothers will be mothers.  "You don't have enough vegetables," my mom said as he grabbed a fork full of <s>Caesar's salad</s> Hearts of Romaine and dumped it on top of my Carrot Bisque soup.  Not wanting to cause a commotion, I did the only thing I really could do; eat that goddamn salad floating on my soup as quickly as possible, stuffing the whole thing in my mouth.  It's kinda like playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chubby_bunny">Chubby Bunny</a>, but with organic ingredients and more humiliating.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And that was my Christmas, really.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Another week, another family dinner with my mother and my 39 year old sister.<br />
<blockquote><strong>Ernie:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>How was your day?</em><br />
<strong> Mom:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I bought cherries today at Safeway.&nbsp; The man told me the cherries were for $1.50, so I bought a whole bunch of them, except when I went to the cash register they charged me $4.50, so I told them $1.50 and they asked if I had</em>&nbsp;<strong>CLUB CARD</strong>&nbsp;<em>and I said I left mine at home so they entered my phone number and they gave me a discount!</em><br />
</blockquote>I swear to God, my mother is turning into the Crazy Asian Ladies that white comedians talk about in their stand-up routines.<br />
<blockquote><strong> Ernie:</strong>&nbsp; <em>(to my sister)</em> And yours?<br />
<strong> Angela:</strong>&nbsp; I did missionary work.<br />
<strong> Mom:</strong>&nbsp; <em>She takes BART and walks around Berkeley by herself for the entire day.</em><br />
<strong>Angela:</strong>&nbsp; It was non-verbal.<br />
</blockquote> It's taken me 19 years, but the whole responsible adult bullshit has caught on to the way I interact with my sister now.&nbsp; Medication keeps her psychosis in check, but in her age and frame of mind, it would be difficult for her to ever transform into a fully functional member of society.&nbsp; I talk to her in a calm and soothing voice as instructed to me by various books on mental illness and in turn, she answers in pleasant one to two word responses.&nbsp; She asks me if I bought the shirt I'm wearing, like every other time I come home, and now I know enough to say, "No, the shirt isn't new, but I bought it at Old Navy, I'm glad you like it" instead of flipping out and asking why she's always asks the same question every time I go home for dinner.<br />
<br />
Sometimes though, when I'm watching Korean soap operas with my mom, she'll turn and look at me, just <em>look</em> at me, as if we were identical twins and she were trying to send some sort of desparate, telepathic message.&nbsp; An action like this would have previously triggered something combative or defensive inside, but now I just silently nod and smile and make a motion to the TV.&nbsp; And when she blankly stares at the sobbing girl eating rice on the television screen, I'll wonder to myself: "What did you want to say?&nbsp; What would you say to me, if you could?&nbsp; Where did everything go horribly, horribly wrong?"<br /><br />]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I spent Christmas Eve with my father's side of the family.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve on my father's side of the family is usually a simple affair - the cousins, aunts and uncles get together and we make polite small chat over lunch.  The cousins would catch up with other in English, all of our respective parents would discuss matters in Mandarin, and we would all excuse apologize afterward for leaving early, as we all had our lives to attend to.</p>

<p>But this year was different - without my mother there, my father was noticably more relaxed.  There were some new additions to the family as well:  my uncle's new wife and eleven year son Hubert had recently moved to the United States from Taiwan, as well as two Chinese girls in their late twenties to early thirties, adopted daughters of my other uncle.  Speaking Mandarin in rapid-fire, this extended branch of cousins jostled and joked with our aunts and uncles and took photographs of each other with peace signs that morphed into bunny ears.  I assume they were having the time of their lives.</p>

<p>On a complete tangeant:  I'm sorry - Hubert is a horrible name.  The reason why Asians choose to rename themselves to something "cooler," like Dickey or Maverick or Yolanda, is because they were born with names like "Hubert."  Would I pick two random characters in a Chinese dictionary if I wanted to give my kid a Chinese name?  No?  Then one of us American cousins should have been notified on the naming of this child, I'm just saying.  And for the record, I really DO know of people who named themselves Dickey, Maverick and Yolanda.</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm digressing; I just needed to get that off my chest, that's all.</p>

<p>I throw a look to my cousins - the ones with English as a first language - and telepathically ask them if we've been replaced by a new set of Chinese-speaking cousins, ones that are polite and respectful to elders and will marry for family appeasement.  My cousin Chris, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cyberwar/etc/script.html">the cool one who's been on Frontline</a>, glares back.  "All signs point to yes," he seems to say.</p>

<p>The lunch conversation only got better.  Mandarin is in <i>italics.</i></p>

<p>No, I didn't really say that.  Out loud.</p>

<p>If there were a time to transcript a moment in my life into a short film, this would have been it; here we were, sitting at the dining table, two cultures clashing on the most important Christian holiday of the year.  Here were these people with good intentions trying to make everything for the better;  I'm sure they're all wonderful people, and I'm something had happened that caused my uncle to invite them into their home, as their adopted daughters, no less.  And here I was, the asshole American cousin, muttering under my breath, sure as hell not feeling the spirit of Christmas.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, I couldn't give a shit.  How dare you try to steal my dysfunctional family, I wanted to tell her.</p>]]></description>

      <title>things i&apos;m indebted to watch because i&apos;m gay:  logo</title>
      <link>http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/?z=post&amp;y=archives/003310</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Logo is a cable television channel that exclusively shows gay and lesbian content.  Like anything else directed to my demographic, I'll occasionally check out the program listings to see if there's anything interesting on the channel.  More often than not though, I find myself skipping Logo and do what I usually do; make fun of G4TV or watch shows on the Food Network as if they were soft-core pornography.</p>

<p>Here are my comments about various shows on the network:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.logoonline.com/shows/dyn/first_comes_love/series.jhtml">First Comes Love</a>:  Hey, tired of watching Wedding programs on TLC full of those weird, heterosexual people?  Thankfully, we have First Comes Love, the GAY wedding planner show starring "that gay guy from Kids In The Hall."

<p>Here is an ACTUAL clip from an episode that I watched; it's paraphrased, but it nails the point:</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Partner #1:</b>  I want drag queens at our wedding.  Lots and lots of drag queens.<br />
<b>Partner #2:</b>  But the last thing I want to be is circus-like.<br />
<b>Ernie:</b> (looks directly at the camera)  Not going there.  Too easy.
</blockquote>

<p>If anything positive were to come out of this show, it's important to note that one of the wedding designers is a man of presumably Filipino heritage named <a href="http://www.logoonline.com/shows/dyn/first_comes_love/personality.jhtml?personalityId=4763">Eric Aragon</a>.  I welcome this, because it brings the "Gay Asians on Televsion" count up to four, including Bobby Trendy, M. Butterfly and, of course, Sulu.</p>

<p>Not that I'm bitter about that.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.logoonline.com/shows/dyn/wonderfalls/series.jhtml">Wonderfalls</a>:  I see this show on Logo all the time, which is funny because I think I saw an episode of this show on FOX; it's about some girl who works in a Niagra Falls gift shop and she imagines her gift shop items talking to her for one reason or another.  Apparently the show wasn't too bad, just doomed to failure like other good FOX sitcoms like <a href="http://www.fox.com/arresteddev/">Arrested Development</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Richter_Controls_the_Universe">Andy Richter Controls the Universe</a>.</p>

<p>But, uhm, why is this on the <i>gay</i> channel?  Seriously, did I miss a major plot point where she comes out as a Lesbian?  Do the talking items in the shop start going gay?</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Key chain:</b>  So I hear the gumball machine hooked up with the snowglobe at Mickey's last night.<br />
<b>Greeting card:</b>  That whore?  Fucking <i>that</i> is like throwing a hot dog down a hallway...<br />
<b>Gumball machine full of M&Ms:</b>  ... excuse you?  Bitch, you don't <i>know</i> me.<br />
<b>Joan, the lead character:</b>  OH MY GOD, SHUT UP, ALL OF YOU.  WHY WON'T YOU INANIMATE OBJECTS STOP TALKING!?
</blockquote>

<p><b>Update:</b>  Okay, after some research, the talking objects were inanimate animals and not gumball machines.  Because that makes SUCH a difference.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.logoonline.com/shows/dyn/noahs_arc/series.jhtml">Noah's arc</a>:  The premise is interesting, and yes, groundbreaking, although from a purely marketting and business point of view would have some trouble standing out from other shows by its name alone.</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Co-worker #1:</b>  I watched <i>Noah's Arc</i> last night.<br />
<b>Co-worker #2:</b>  Oh, really?  What is it about?<br />
<b>Co-worker #1:</b>  Well.. hmmm... how do I put this delicately?
</blockquote>

<p>Let's contrast this to what I think would be a name that would generate more interest in the televsion program:</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Co-worker #1:</b>  I watched <i>Black Gay Soap Opera</i> last night.<br />
<b>Co-worker #2:</b>  Oh, really?  What is it about?<br />
<b>Co-worker #1:</b>  <i>(Co-worker #1 pauses, then punches co-worker #2 in the face)</i>
</blockquote>

<p>See?  Everyone wins!</p></li>

      <title>spew</title>
      <link>http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/?z=post&amp;y=archives/003304</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Because if I write any more about my family, I'll have to change this to a LiveJournal and start posting Evanescence lyrics.</p>

<p>This Friday, I went to my friend Royce's Christmas Party.  Not a big deal - I took him to my Christmas Party and he repaid the favor, so I see it more as a student exchange program, except instead of visiting Holland, you're politely eating Chicken in a suit with people you don't know.  A nice dinner for the price of $Free.99?  The Asian in me <i>loves</i> that shit.</p>

<p>Royce also organized the Christmas Party.  In a relatively conservative company that is 80% Asian.  No good can come from this.</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Royce:</b>  I'll need three volunteers from the audience for a contest.  The winner wins a digital camera.<br />
<i>(After much goading, three volunteers come onto the stage.)</i><br />
<b>Royce:</b>  Okay guys, we're gonna play a game called "SPEW."
</blockquote>

<p>There is absolutely, positively NO good that can come from a game called <i>Spew</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Royce:</b>  The object of this game is to put in an Alka-Seltzer, then drink take a hard swig of this bottle of Diet Coke.  The last person to spew out all the foam on the dance floor wins.<br />
<b>Everyone on stage:</b> ...<br>
<b>Ernie:</b> <i>(thinking to himself)</i>  You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din.
</blockquote>

<p>One thing though - when it comes to something like a digital camera, Asians will do anything - anything - to win.  If it involved downing the whole package of Alka-Seltzer and doing a kegstand of club soda, they'd do it just for the chance to buy one less gift for their kids.</p>

<p>I <i>love</i> my people.</p>

      <title>nothing and everything again</title>
      <link>http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/?z=post&amp;y=archives/003292</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The dust has settled, I think, though the damage had been done; the stress hives I had this summer have been reduced to unfortunate, permanent battle scars from scratching them so damn much and the <a href="http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/?z=post&y=archives/003197">giant white elephant in the room</a> has hopefully migrated south, where the weather is a little bit warmer.</p>

<p>I'm learning that when you've been in a relationship for a long time, you build a routine that's safe and predictable and monotonous and... strangely comforting.  When all that ends, you find yourself trying to figure out your next steps and adjusting to little things, like sleeping on the center of the bed and trying to figure out what to do on a Friday night when usually, you would hang out together and watch DVDs.<p>

<p>"You know Ernie, you were single for seven years," interjects the white elephant.  "You could be single for seven more.  How old would that make you?  Like, 36?"</p>
<p>"Dude, aren't you supposed to be by the equator?"</p>
"Supposed to be.  My bad."  And with that, the figment of my over-active imagination flies away, if only for now.</p>

<p><center>-----</center></p>

<p>That being said, I've started to hang out with him again, if for no reason than to stop having my emotions manifest itself into something darker.  That, and where else am I going to get a bunch of bootleg CD's, right?  So we're at Mel's in San Francisco after this video game event.</p>

<blockquote>
<b>This guy I know:</b>  Hey man.  I really liked your post about your parent's divorce.<br />
<b>Ernie:</b>  Thanks.<p>

<b>The Ex:</b>  Look at you, blogger celebrity.<br />
<b>Ernie:</b>  Naaah, I met him when I did <a href="http://jaschu.wordpress.com/2005/10/24/lap-pop-videos-ernie/">my blog reading a couple of weeks back</a>.  Nice guy.<br />
<b>The Ex:</b>  What, is someone coming up to you saying that they liked your parent's divorce kind of having a groupie go up to a DJ and tell them they liked Track 3 of their new CD?<br />
<b>Ernie:</b>  Yes, that's exactly what it's like.<br />
<b>The Ex:</b>  Seriously?<br />
<b>Ernie:</b>  No.
</blockquote>

<p>I'll say it again - nothing has changed, yet everything has, and will some more.</p>]]></description>

      <title>nothing and everything</title>
      <link>http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/?z=post&amp;y=archives/003285</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>So, if I am to believe my mother in her frantic cellphone call tonight, my parent's divorce became final as of this afternoon.</p>

<p>Now, I love my mother; of course I love my mother.  But I also get my gift of exaggeration from her, so she might be stretching the truth - something tells me she's not, however.  Her previous warnings that mommy and daddy are getting a <i>divorce</i> - always pronounced in English, so I understand the gravity of the statement - were always in future tense.  Tonight, the <i>divorce</i> was in past tense.  <i>Dee-vor-sse.</i></p>

<p>As for my father:  he has requested me to not talk about him or his character on this weblog anymore.  I will respect his wishes.</p>

<p>I don't need sympathy because it's been a long time coming, I suppose; they've fought since I was a little kid, screaming matches that as a kid would have me burst into tears, run to my bedroom, slam the door and cry into my pillow at age seven, arguments that inspire the awkward but polite "hey there, everything alright?" with the neighbors, fights where the police are called, most likely accompanied by at least one Mandarin speaking officer, furiously translating to all the he-said she-said bullshit.  Arguments that have always made me a bit skittish in the course of any conflict at all, stuff that I'll have to deal with for the rest of my life, not to be overly dramatic or anything.  But I'm an adult and I have to deal with it.</p>

<p>Nothing has changed from yesterday, really.  My parents continue to live apart, I will still go to Mom's house every Tuesday, and I continue mending the relationship with my Dad.</p>

<p>And although nothing has changed, everything has changed.  I guess that's why there's a mix of emotions that are difficult for me to decipher right now:  relief because a fractured relationship with my parents needed closure, a bit of caution for the unknown, and a bit of shame.  </p>

<p>Wait.  No.  Not shame.  I'm not ashamed that my parents got divorced, far from it, thank fucking God that someone was finally able to do something proactive to derail that fucking train to Miseryville. If anything, I'm ashamed that our family had to break the notions of the typical Chinese family.  The good Chinese family doesn't end in divorce.</p>

<p>Of course, the good Chinese family doesn't have a gay son or a mentally disabled daughter, either.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, my drivers license came today with a new photograph.  The picture of my old drivers license was literally ten years old, a nineteen year old college student with a double-chin, a salad bowl haircut, and a manic, addictive personality, living on his own for the first time and was delighted at the sweet taste of independance and rebellion from strict parental control and feeling I was pretty fucking invincible.</p>

<p>And now I see myself ten years later at age 29, still with that manic, addictive personality, but now a little bit torn and tattered, a little less invincible.  I'm learning that life continues no matter how many curveballs are thrown at you, but you deal with it and you have your friends to keep you sane and you begrudgingly wake up to live another day, because what else are you going to do?  And of course, I still have that ridiculous haircut, just with a little bit of hair gel to hide the acres of bangs.</p>

<p>Nothing has changed, yet everything has, and will some more.</p>]]></description>

.flickr-frame {	float: right; text-align: center; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; }
</style>

<div class="flickr-frame">
	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ernie/58895740/" title="photo sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/31/58895740_c2469405d9_t.jpg" class="flickr-photo" alt="Margaret Cho and I" /></a>
</div>
And this is a picture with Margaret Cho and myself while she was doing a reading for her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=littleyellowd-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1573223190/qid=1130919369/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1?v=glance%26s=books">I Have Chosen to Stay and Fight</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=littleyellowd-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> up in Berkeley.  <br />
<br />
I've been a fan of hers when she was "just" an stand-up comic focusing on Asian issues and even more so when she talked about gay issues, so when my friend Adam talked me into commuting from the South Bay up to Berkeley to get her book signed and to say hi, I figured, hey, why not?  My blog is linked off her website, after all.
<p>This is the conversation we had when she was signing my book:</p>
<blockquote>
"So, uhm, I'm a big fan.  You link my website from your blog."<br />
"Really?  Whats your website?"<br />
"Little Yellow Different."<br />
"Oh.  Yeah, that's a good site. It's funny."<br />
"I'm glad you like it."<br />
"..."<br />
"..."<br />
"Okay, next person in line?"</blockquote>

<p>To be totally honest, I'm not quite sure what conversation we would have had, given the fact that it was a booksigning and she only has 30 to 45 seconds to talk to everyone in line anyway; I wasn't sure if she would be in comedienne mode, whether we would go into instant banter as to who would have the wackier mother story, a competition I would have had the utmost pleasure at losing.  Actually, to my surprise, she was polite, a little reserved, a little overwhelmed at signing books to her legions of adoring fans, which from what I could tell from the line at Codys consisted of angry adoring Asian college students, angry adoring hippies and angry adoring homosexuals.</p>

<p>It was kind of a relief, actually.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This weekend, I went to the Castro Street Fair with some friends.  As I've had a ridicuously shitty past couple of months, it was good to hang out with friends.</p>

<p>Also, blog fodder.  There's always blog fodder.  <s>I'll leave the person involved with this conversation anonymous until he's <i>really</i> okay with me posting details about his personal life.  (Or until he gets his website up, whatever's first.)</s>  Okay, I'll say it; <a title="'CLICK ON THE TARGET TO ENTER.'  how very 1998." href="http://www.agentadam.com">it's Adam</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>(The scene:  Ernie is walking up Castro Street with some friends.  He's eating a chocolate chip cookie when two forsames* come up to me with a boutique beautiy store t-shirt.  "You look like you like free stuff, Asian boy," they seem to say, hand me the shirt, and walk away.)</i></p>

<b>Ernie:</b>  Oooh, hey guys, I just got a free t-shirt!<br />
<b>Friend:</b>  Ugh, lucky bitch.  The last time I got a free t-shirt I had to suck cock for it.

<p><i>(Cut to Ernie, choking on said chocolate chip cookie)</i></p>
<b>Ernie:</b>  ...<br />
<b>Friend:</b>  What?  We were at Power House, he was kinda cute.  I went down on him.  Turns out he worked for some DVD company and gave me a t-shirt afterwards.  <br />
<b>Ernie:</b> ...<br />
<b>Friend:</b> ...<br />
<b>Ernie:</b>  Uhm.. what would you have done for a water bottle?  A paperweight?  How bout one of those lightweight rubber frisbees?<br />
<b>Friend:</b>  Oooh.  Well, first, I would probably...<br />
<b>Ernie:</b>  Oh look!  A booth that sells rainbow windchimes!
</blockquote>

<p>* I got the term <i>forsame</i> from my friend Royce.  As in, "Gay White Male, in-shape, masculine and attractive in his late 20's seeks <i>forsame</i> for friends."  Use it in a derogatory term today!</p>]]></description>
