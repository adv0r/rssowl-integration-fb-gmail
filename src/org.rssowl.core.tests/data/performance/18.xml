<title>NBA Playoffs: Heat Smother Pistons, Win Game 1</title>
<link>http://www.nbc11.com/sports/9264819/detail.html?rss=bay&amp;psp=sports</link>
<description>Dwyane Wade made the most of his limited time on the floor with 25 points, and Miami used a suffocating defense to top the Detroit Pistons, 91-86, in the opener of the Eastern Conference finals. Wade played less than 27 minutes, but shot 9-of-11 from the field and went 7- of-9 at the foul line. His minutes were shaved after being charged with three fouls in the first half, but Antoine Walker picked up the scoring slack with 17 points. Shaquille O'Neal added 14 points and eight boards, while Gary Payton also scored 14 for Miami, which shot 56.3 percent from the field and held Detroit to 37.8 percent. Richard Hamilton tallied 22 points for Detroit, while Chauncey Billups added 19 points, but the guard tandem combined to go 15-of-41 from the field. Tayshaun Prince contributed 16 points for the Pistons, who struggled by shooting 5-of-21 from three-point range. Rasheed Wallace was held to seven points. Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is Thursday night at the Palace.</description>
