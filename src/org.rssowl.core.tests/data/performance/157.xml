        <title>ABC Puts It All Out There for Upfronts, or Not</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="center" alt="20060524abcmw.jpg" src="http://www.gawker.com/images/2006/05/20060524abcmw.jpg" width="340" height="255" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Last week brought the TV networks' upfront dog-and-pony shows for advertisers, and this week's coverage makes clear that the most successful shtick came from ABC Entertainment president Steve McPherson, who after weeks of training did some &lt;I&gt;Dancing With the Stars&lt;/i&gt;-quality hoofing on the Lincoln Center stage, accompanied by a professional dancer. What's less clear, however, is what that pro-dancer partner was wearing. Up top is &lt;I&gt;Mediaweek&lt;/I&gt;'s chaste version of the publicity shot. Below left is &lt;I&gt;Ad Age&lt;/I&gt;'s seemingly unexpurgated version of what otherwise seems to be the very same image, and below right is &lt;I&gt;Newsweek&lt;/i&gt;'s take -- idtentical but, curiously, with a bit of added shadowing. We got no idea. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img class="center" alt="20060524abcboth.jpg" src="http://www.gawker.com/images/2006/05/20060524abcboth.jpg" width="340" height="226" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All three complete images after the jump.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blogorrhea NYC: Thank You, Come Again</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226; An exit strategy is always important, never more so than when you're leaving a club and want to make it out alive. [&lt;a href="http://standingonthebox.blogspot.com/2006/05/close.html"&gt;Clublife&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>WireImage Is Nobody's Friend</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.gawker.com/images/2006/05/axlbrawl.jpg" class="right"&gt;A weird little sidenote to the Axl Rose/Tommy Hilfiger beat down on Thursday night: the photo of the two fighting on the cover of the Saturday &lt;i&gt;Post&lt;/i&gt; is credited to DMI, an "independent" photo agency owned by MediaVast, which also owns WireImage. Writes a reader in the know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Post's cover photo was taken by a Wireimage photographer inside the nightclub Plumm, and marketed under DMI to protect Wireimage's celeb-friendly image.  They won't make celebrities look bad, and publicists know that.  You won't find passed out, drunken people in the Wireimage archives.  Wireimage is known to pull images off their site at a celebrity's request.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by funneling the less-flattering photos to their sketchy sibling, WireImage stays cozy with the PR gatekeepers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concludes today's lesson in celebrity photojournalism. Tomorrow: what's up with Patrick McMullan's hair?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>To-Do: Cool Culture, Dave Hill, or La Moustache</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226; Beyond the fact that Cool Culture opens museums and zoos to thousands of disadavantaged families, its benefit tonight is hosted by chic types.  Do it for the children. And the scene. [&lt;a href="http://www.cool-culture.org/benefit/index.html"&gt;Cool Culture&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8226; The Dave Hill Explosion hits UCB, featuring beloved &lt;i&gt;SNL&lt;/i&gt; freak Fred Armisen, musician Walter Schreifels, and dear Malcom Gladwell.  Don't miss the chance to see his hair live. [&lt;a href="http://www.davehillonline.com"&gt;Dave Hill&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8226; What would a French film be without an existential crisis? Neither French nor hip.  Luckily, &lt;i&gt;La Moustache&lt;/i&gt; meets the requirement and adds some bonus facial hair, just to bring it home. [&lt;a href="http://beta.nyc.flavorpill.net/16244"&gt;flavorpill&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Classic Gawker Stalker: Mike Myers Spotted With -- Drumroll, Please -- a Hockey Stick</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sightings are sent in by readers and posted to our &lt;a href="http://www.gawker.com/stalker"&gt;Gawker Stalker Map&lt;/a&gt;. This is our occasional text compilation of recent adventures in starfucking. Send your sightings to tips@gawker.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this old-school edition of the Stalk: Mike Myers with his trademark accoutrement; P. Diddy, David Byrne, T.I. and an unidentified rapper at the Gnarls Barkley show; Russell Simmons, Carmelo Anthony and LaLa Vasquez, Jeffrey Ross, and Ice-T and Coco at the Blender Magazine party; Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman, Joaquin Phoenix, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Heath Ledger, Julia Roberts, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Bill Clinton, Benicio del Toro, Harrison Ford, Sarah Jessica Parker, Uma Thurman, Julianne Moore, Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Jon Stewart, Matt Dillon, Paul Giamatti, Malcolm Gladwell, James Marsden, Jeremy Sisto, Seth Green, Patrick Dempsey and Amy Adams, Tate Donovan, Logan Marshall-Green, Kate Moennig, Freddy Adu, Chris Carrabba, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Ed Burns and Christie Turlington, Mort Zuckerman, Seth Meyers, John McGinley, Emily Bishop, Michael McKean, Lou Dobbs, Frank Gifford, and Isaac Mizrahi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday afternoon, Ludlow Street, &lt;strong&gt;Mike Myers&lt;/strong&gt; talking on his cell phone and carrying a freakin' hockey stick.  When he saw me notice him, he pointedly turned his back on me as he talked on his phone.  Easy, dude, my eyes weren't bugging out because I was thinking "Wow, it's Mike Myers, I should ask for his autograph;" they were bugging out because I was thinking "Jesus H Christ, it's Mike Myers, and he really DOES carry his hockey stick everywhere."  Once I was out of earshot--or, admittedly, maybe before--I started giggling to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gnarls Barkley show last night at Webster Hall was quite the event.  Waiting outside, I watched James Blunt shyly enter the venue, scraggly hair, stubble, and babe in check.  He looked depressed, or maybe just high.  &lt;strong&gt;P. Diddy&lt;/strong&gt; was upstairs on the left side of the balcony, acknowledged by Cee-lo towards the end of the show, along with rapper T.I. and another member of the Goodie Mob (either T-Mo, Big Gipp, or Khujo, I can't remember).  &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne&lt;/strong&gt; was at the other end of the balcony. Either way it was ridiculous and great.  Cee-lo said fuck/motherfucker/fucking about 40x throughout, was wearing extremely tight yellow spandex, a sleeveless black shirt (the man weighs 325 lbs mind you), and a cape that looked like a pair of those Zoomba pants from back in the day.      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just got home from the Blender party on 31st and 10th, I'm a little drunk but let's see: we had &lt;b&gt;Russell Simmons&lt;/b&gt; not being allowed to cut the men's room line by some guy with a Staten Island accent; &lt;b&gt;Carmelo Anthony&lt;/b&gt; wearing a Michael Jordan t-shirt with MTV VJ &lt;b&gt;LaLa Vasquez&lt;/b&gt;; &lt;b&gt;Jeffery Ross&lt;/b&gt; with a hot girl; &lt;b&gt;Ice-T and Coco.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just saw &lt;b&gt;Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman&lt;/b&gt; on the corner of Bleecker and Perry, walking past Olive and Bette's.  They looked like friends without the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;b&gt;Joaquin Phoenix&lt;/b&gt; on Monday night while I was sitting outside Cake Shop on Ludlow.  He came out of a bar next door and got into a black Toyota with 4 other older guys.  He looked a little drunk and aloof, smoking a cigarette and staring out the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;b&gt;Mary-Kate and Ashley&lt;/b&gt; at a Free Arts benefit last night on 15th and 10th ave. They were sitting at the only table in the entire place, in a corner, looking bored and miserable. I thought that was messed up considering they were hosting the event. Mary-Kate had awful hair extensions, but Ashley was looking cute. Also was in the elevator on the way out with Aerin Lauder, who is pretty average looking when it all comes down to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, may 23rd around 6pm on court st. in Brooklyn, saw &lt;b&gt;Heath Ledger&lt;/b&gt; wearing his usual grunge, including an orange hat, sunglasses and skateboard in hand.  Looked pretty serious--was he trying to figure out how to come up with the bail money for his father-in-law?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 20, 1 PM.  7th ave and 39th st: &lt;b&gt;Julia Roberts&lt;/b&gt; walking arm and arm with her gigantic body guard.  She is very skinny, perhaps even gangly.  She dresses very thrift store in a bad way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just ate lunch next to &lt;b&gt;Jennifer Jason Leigh&lt;/b&gt; at Cafe Habana in Soho (Elizabeth and Prince).  She was with a really cute guy and another woman and they were talking a lot about yoga...I think the guy is her yoga teacher.  She looked a little tired.  Later today, I spotted her again on a film set (Prince and Crosby) in the same outfit.  She must be filming a movie in soho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw &lt;b&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/b&gt; in front of Cooper Union (Astor place in between cooper and 3rd).  A crowd was gathered around him. I saw the top of his white head and big nose. It looked like cooper union's commencement was going on, so perhaps it had something to do with that. He rolled up in a black on black, tinted suburban. Talked for maybe 5 minutes and then left. People were filming all of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotted &lt;b&gt;Benicio del Toro&lt;/b&gt; looking scruffy but sexy just 5 minutes ago on 21st, b/t 5th and 6th.  Tall and climb-able with a baseball cap and overgrown sideburns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;b&gt;Harrison Ford&lt;/b&gt; yesterday walking on 21st street between 6th and 7th avenues.  He had a full gray beard, wearing a denim jacket and was walking a bit hunched over carrying two large shopping bags.  Not a tall man and appeared cranky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday afternoon, May 18th, around 3:30 pm. &lt;b&gt;Sarah Jessica Parker&lt;/b&gt; shopping alone on the 5th floor of Barney's. I was surprised at just how tiny she is in person. Wearing jeans, sneakers, a baggy tank top, no makeup. She looked tired as any mother of a toddler would. I almost bumped into her and she very meekly said "oh sorry" while keeping her head down, totally unassuming, definitely not wanting to call attention to herself. Put a big pile of clothes on the counter and disappeared while they were being rung up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy crap, Batman! Just saw Poison Ivy -- I mean &lt;b&gt;Uma Thurman&lt;/b&gt; -- eating lunch on 17th and Bway (Enju). A coworker lingered behind to bask in her awesomeness.  Nothing much exciting happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Julianne Moore&lt;/b&gt;: Monday, May 22, circa 5:30: walking with child west on West 18th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues.  Tiny and pale, sporting huge sunglasses.  Turning heads along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw &lt;b&gt;Jay Z&lt;/b&gt; (sans Beyonce) Friday night at The Spotted Pig in the West Village, holding court in the upstairs alcove area. &lt;b&gt;Jill Hennessy&lt;/b&gt; of Crossing Jordan/Law &amp;amp; Order fame was also there, looking very unassuming--jeans, ponytail, and naturally pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lil Wayne&lt;/b&gt;, looking like a younger Lil Jon, weaving a Benz through traffic on 6th Ave at 30th.  Weaved hair, fitted hat, gold gangster grill and all... He was by himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noon, 5/23/6... Just saw &lt;b&gt;Jon Stewart&lt;/b&gt; walking through Union Square talking on his cell phone. He was wearing a gray shirt and baseball cap, looking very good! As a PA I wanted to grab him and beg for a Daily Show gig- but as a chick I just wanted to grab him!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;b&gt;Matt Dillon&lt;/b&gt; at Balthazar; he smiled at me and is as hot in person as he is on screen. He was with 2 very attractive ladies (what a shock) and was acting nice to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Paul Giamatti&lt;/b&gt;, Pierrepont St., Brooklyn Heights, May 21st at 8:30pm: standing in the doorway of his building with his son, calling to his wife Liz, who was going to a car.  He has gotten rid of that scruffy bearded look and is clean-shaven now with a very short haircut, but still retains the black framed glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;b&gt;Malcolm Gladwell&lt;/b&gt; of "The Tipping Point" fame tonight around 8 walking at Waverly Pl and W. 10th.  His hair gave him away and he looked just as cool as his books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday, May 20th, around 5pm, I walked right by &lt;b&gt;James Marsden&lt;/b&gt; on Prince Street, between Mercer and Greene Street. He was smiling and looking hot in a baseball cap, accompanied by another famous looking guy I couldn't place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw &lt;b&gt;Jeremy Sisto&lt;/b&gt; last night at Island Burger (52nd and 9th) at 9 pm Tuesday, sporting quite the wild 'do and 5-a.m.-with-a-hangover stubble.  He did indeed look crazy enough to have sex with his sister, though if the sister is Rachel Griffiths, I could get down with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seth Green&lt;/b&gt;: 59th street by central park, 2:30pm: He was wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses. He was so so short. Was with a girl about 2 inches taller then him, she was   very pretty. They were also filming a movie at central park by Columbus Circle. A lot people crowding it, cops and film crew so I couldn't see who the actors were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning at about 8:15am, as I was walking down Central Park West to the subway at Columbus Circle, I saw a woman wearing a hideous mint green gown with a flower pattern on it.  She was standing just past the Trump Hotel, right before the subway entrance.  At first I thought she was a really tragic bridesmaid, waiting for some Tuesday morning wedding in Central Park.  As I got closer, I realized that it was &lt;b&gt;Amy Adams&lt;/b&gt; and standing next to her (very close) was &lt;b&gt;Patrick Dempsey&lt;/b&gt;.  I think he was wearing a dark suit.  There didn't seem to be any cameras, film crews or anything else around, but maybe in my early morning haze, I just didn't notice...actually, maybe it was standing that close to Patrick Dempsey that made me notice nothing else but his eyes...and that hideous dress.  &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Just saw &lt;b&gt;Tate Donovan&lt;/b&gt; (1:45pm) on Hudson between Morton &amp;amp; Leroy. Just strolling, no sunglasses, no cell, no one with him. Looked the same as he did on the O.C. season one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trey from the OC, aka Ryan's brother who just got out of jail and was killed by Marissa last season, aka &lt;b&gt;Logan Marshall-Green&lt;/b&gt;, at Cosi on 31st and Park in the salad line. Looked very bikerish.....jeans, black leather studded jacket and black sunglasses....YUM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;b&gt;Kate Moennig&lt;/b&gt; of L Word fame crossing 14th St. at 3rd Ave. on my way to the L this afternoon around 3:30 pm. She looked really (really) thin, but her hair looked good. Slim trousers, hat, maybe a blazer but I am possibly making that last part up because it was pretty warm out. She also looked sort of angry, maybe just in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 2:45 pm, May 22 on the E train platform at Penn Station, I saw soccer phenom &lt;b&gt;Freddy Adu&lt;/b&gt; or his stunt double waiting for the E.  5'6"-5'8" with ipod in tow and Razor in hand.  He went on into Queens.  I thought he'd take a cab, but hey, he's young and probably slummin' with the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw the lead singer of the band Dashboard Confessional (&lt;b&gt;Chris Carrabba&lt;/b&gt;) at a bar on Hudson just below 11th street in the West Village, looking very much like a emo-punk version of Jughead from Archie Comics, complete with varnished pompadour and tattooed sleeves (missing the crown). He was being photographed and seemed to enjoy pretending like it was 2001 and he was still getting laid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just saw &lt;b&gt;Mary Lynn Rajskub&lt;/b&gt;, aka Chloe from 24, coming out of one of those scam electronics stores, on 6th and 58th at 2:00pm. Irony at its best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A beautiful Saturday in New York on the way to the CP Zoo with my kids was nearly ruined by the appearance of one-hit-wonder director &lt;b&gt;Ed Burns&lt;/b&gt;. He was looking intentionally scruffy outside of his building on 5th unloading some kid stuff from a Lexus 330. I was horrified that he might be my lone celeb sighting of the day, when thankfully, his wife, the ultimate yummy mummy &lt;b&gt;Christie Turlington&lt;/b&gt;, emerged from the car. She's very beautiful and looked great. Just a reminder that there really is no justice in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.55pm corner of park and 48th. &lt;b&gt;Mort Zuckerman&lt;/b&gt; talking on his cellphone and, inexplicably, wearing a plastic badge with his name on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotted SNL hottie &lt;b&gt;Seth Meyers&lt;/b&gt; shaking hands with another young hot guy (couldn't place him) at Sant Ambroeus restaurant in the village.  Too bad they were both with ladies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 22nd. Saw &lt;b&gt;John McGinley&lt;/b&gt; -- the wise cracking Dr. Perry Cox who makes Zach Braff's life miserable on the show Scrubs -- walking around Union Square market at 5pm with friends (an attractive blonde and another man). He's pretty good looking and has a great body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been kissed by a Gilmore Girl. Just ran into Gramma Emily herself, the regal &lt;b&gt;Kelly Bishop&lt;/b&gt;, on the corner of 93rd and Madison. She was very gracious, signed an autograph and pecked my cheek. I'm so happy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael McKean&lt;/b&gt; at Film Forum's B Noir double feature showing of Among the Living and The Spiritualist. Left after the first screening. Looked like all nice and regular like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just saw &lt;b&gt;Lou Dobbs&lt;/b&gt; talking to a salesperson in the Bose store in the Shops at Columbus Circle. Ironically, the salesperson looked to be of Mexican descent and was talking with an accent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, May 23rd, 12:30 pm: I saw &lt;b&gt;Frank Gifford&lt;/b&gt; strolling along 5th Avenue near 58th Street. Always the well-dressed gentleman, he was in a blue blazer with an appropriate tie and slacks, carrying a small gift bag. I didn't notice from which store, although he was window shopping at Bergdorf Goodman when I saw him. No sign of Kathie Lee however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw &lt;b&gt;Isaac Mizrahi&lt;/b&gt; on Monday 5/22 on the corner of 17th and 5th, being interviewed by a TV crew.  Not sure what it was for, but he was dressed casually and wearing a red bandana.  My friend was hoping he'd grab her boob, but no such luck.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gawker.com/news/stalker/classic-gawker-stalker-mike-myers-spotted-with-drumroll-please-a-hockey-stick-176046.php"&gt;Comment on this post&lt;/a&gt;

        <title>Media Bubble: The Philadelphia Story</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226; Philly guys officially snag KR's Philly papers from McClatchy. [&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/business/media/24paper.html"&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;#8226; Despite AMI noncompete, &lt;I&gt;Star&lt;/I&gt; vet Mark Coleman to become deputy editor at Bauer's &lt;I&gt;Life &amp;amp; Style&lt;/i&gt;, setting off various other staff moves too mundane for you to care much about.

        <title>It'll Be Like Fleet Week, but With Fewer Closet Cases</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="center" alt="20060524gayrugby.jpg" src="http://www.gawker.com/images/2006/05/20060524gayrugby.jpg" width="340" height="148" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There's no particularly great reason to be telling you about this, except that several people excitedly told us about it yesterday and, knowing the proclivities of a good chunk of you folks, we suspect you'll be excited about it, too. There's a gay rugby tournament coming to the city this weekend. That is to say, there will be something like 1,000 big burly gay jocks wandering the streets of Manhattan this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It suddenly makes not having a place on Fire Island for Memorial Day seem much less unfortunate, doesn't it?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Curbed Launches the Beach, Hamptonites Forced to Learn About Blogs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="hamptonshell.jpg" src="http://www.gawker.com/images/2006/05/hamptonshell.jpg" width="180" height="137" class="right"/&gt;Mentally speaking, Memorial Day weekend is already here, and we're already envisioning long, lazy weekends spent stalling on the L.I.E., deeply inhaling the fumes of Manhattan's exodus while working on the tan of our left arm. In honor of such an occasion, the &lt;a href="http://www.curbed.com"&gt;Curbed&lt;/a&gt; Network launches &lt;a href="http://beach.curbed.com/"&gt;The Beach&lt;/a&gt;, a blog devoted to all things East End, from traffic and weather to clubland and STD-swapping. Live-blogging of summer share blackouts will be brought to you courtesy of &lt;a href="http://eater.curbed.com"&gt;Eater&lt;/a&gt; blogger Ben Leventhal and &lt;a href="http://stilettosoncobblestone.blogspot.com/"&gt;Noa Taffet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the proprietor of Curbed, Eater and The Beach is Lockhart Steele, Gawker Media's M.E. and Nick Denton's personal whip-holder -- meaning that this whole thing reeks of &lt;i&gt;Single White Female&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Secret Lives of (Some) Writers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="center" alt="20060524esb.jpg" src="http://www.gawker.com/images/2006/05/20060524esb.jpg" width="250" height="332" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Rick Marin and Ilene Rosenzweig -- a married pair of New York writers, he formerly a &lt;I&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; style scribe and the author of &lt;I&gt;Cad&lt;/I&gt;, she formerly a &lt;I&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; style editor and the author, with Cynthia Rowley, of the &lt;I&gt;Swell&lt;/i&gt; books -- are leaving Manhattan with their family for first the Hamptons and then Los Angeles. They had a farewell party in their Flatiron apartment last night, and it was not so much the expansive space or the high design or the fountain of flowing chocolate or even the amazing views that got us. The &lt;I&gt;ice sculptures of the amazing views&lt;/i&gt; are what ultimately made us realize: Writers get to live like this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly we're doing something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Frank Bruni Is an American Hero</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="right" alt="20060524bruni.jpg" src="http://www.gawker.com/images/2006/05/20060524bruni.jpg" width="150" height="150" /&gt;Today's dining section carries a huge Frank Bruni piece (or, at least, a hugely arted Bruni piece) detailing a cross-country drive on which he sampled nearly ever sort of fast food known to Americans -- 9 days, 15 states, 3,650 miles and 42 visits to 35 establishments, as he reports. He ate In-N-Out burgers in California, Whataburgers in Louisiana, Varsity hot dogs in Atlanta, Sonic tots in Kentucky, and White Castle sliders in New Jersey. He did it all in a rented Taurus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have no joke here, no dig. We just want to say that Frank Bruni is our hero. That is all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it's Wednesday and, well, just because, &lt;a href="http://www.consumerist.com"&gt;Consumerist&lt;/a&gt; editor Ben Popken would like everyone to know that he went to elementary school with &lt;i&gt;Devil Wears Prada&lt;/i&gt; star Anne Hathaway in Millburn, New Jersey. We figured it was worth sharing, if only to help Anna Wintour build her surveillance file.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Time Inc. Can Almost Sort of Maybe Guarantee They're Mostly Done Laying People Off</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="right" alt="20050826timeinc.jpg" src="http://www.gawker.com/images/2006/05/20050826timeinc.jpg" width="150" height="227" /&gt;So after Time Inc. made it through those tumultuous rounds of layoffs and other cutbacks a few months ago, it's all clear sailing these days at 1271 Sixth Avenue, right? Well, maybe not. Chairman Ann Moore's quarterly status report went out to Time Inc.'ers yesterday, and it starts on a bad note -- that Q1 at the mag publisher was "less robust than we expected," coming in below last year's Q1. But then things pick up: The new management structure is leaner and faster! The mags are all industry leaders! The whole thing is a very important part of Time Warner! The web! And, of course, there's this bit of heartwarming job-security news: After all those earlier layoffs, "we do hope the majority of eliminations is behind us." We're sure those of you still toiling at the company will sleep soundly after that declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moore's full memo -- full of encouragement for maintaining internal compasses -- is after the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;May 23, 2006
&lt;BR&gt;To: Time Inc. Staff 
&lt;BR&gt;From: Ann Moore 
&lt;BR&gt;Re: Q1 Update
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;A few weeks ago Time Warner announced that our company is off to a good start this year, with first quarter financial results meeting overall expectations. I want to take this opportunity to update you on Time Inc.'s performance and progress against our 2006 goals. As Dick Parsons stated, it is fair to say that Time Inc.'s first quarter was less robust than we expected. Our earnings were down year over year due to challenges you are all well aware of, including continuing volatility in the advertising business. 
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;To address these challenges we recently streamlined our management team. I'm pleased to report it has already had a major impact in how this company is run -- decisions are being made at a faster rate; we are integrating and leveraging our collective assets more effectively; and we are working to improve information flow and internal communications. 
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately as we've reorganized the company, we've also had to eliminate a number of positions. I know it's been unsettling for many of you, but we do hope the majority of eliminations is behind us. I also want to emphasize that cost-cutting was not the sole factor in this effort. In order to operate more efficiently, effectively and competitively we have had to reallocate our assets to invest in areas of higher growth. While magazines continue to be our core business, we are transforming Time Inc. into a multi-platform media company and translating our best-in-class content to other formats which complement print -- including television shows, satellite radio, events and conferences and, of course, digital. 
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;Investing in online/wireless has been one of our top goals for 2006 and we are having good success. Sports Illustrated continues to lead the magazine industry in delivering its content across new digital platforms. SI.com continues to be the largest magazine-based website. The swimsuit package in the first quarter with online and video download components was dazzling; and more recently, columnist Rick Reilly's weekly video segment, Riffs of Reilly, is now available exclusively on Verizon V-Cast mobile phones and SI.com. According to Nielsen/Net Ratings, CNNMoney.com reaches 8.5 million unique visitors, and in just five months since launching, it has catapulted from being the 8th largest online financial destination to the 3rd. People.com continues to break news regularly, most recently the birth of Suri Cruise, and the site was just recognized by MIN as "website of the year." Essence.com broke news last month with their reporting on developments in the Duke lacrosse team case. Time.com is also breaking news, like the resignation of Rep. Tom Delay a few weeks ago. With the groundbreaking addition of bloggers such as Andrew Sullivan and Ana Marie Cox, traffic is up over 40% from last year. EW.com is attracting more visitors than ever thanks in part to Jessica Shaw's regular Friday interview with each week's exiting American Idol contestant.
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;Another 2006 goal is repositioning our core titles for growth. By aggregating the selling and marketing operations of our business titles into the new powerhouse Time Inc. Business and Finance Network, we are now servicing a multi-platform business of size and unmatched scale at 20 million readers. Combining sales and marketing may not be a solution for all of our clusters, in this case it made good sense. 
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;Our new corporate sales and marketing division has been turned into an innovative idea factory. Robin Domeniconi has hired a great team of creative marketing problem-solvers and they have quickly developed a game plan for success. One of their primary strategies is to drive research and insight across the entire organization leveraging our unrivaled knowledge of the consumer under the leadership of Betsy Frank, the widely recognized research "guru," who joined us from Viacom last month. Finding, retaining and motivating the best talent in the industry continues to be a top priority in all areas of the company. 
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;It's important to remember that Time Inc. is still the unqualified industry leader. We're by far the top magazine company in the U.S. with four of the top ten PIB titles. Time Inc. ranks number one or two in most consumer magazine categories ranging from news, entertainment, business, sports and fashion. Internationally we're the market leader in the U.K. with IPC and we have a very strong presence in Mexico with GEE. International editions of Time and Fortune continue to be well-read and highly regarded around the world. Sports Illustrated just signed a deal to launch in China, In Style is a power brand around the world and is launching in Turkey this year, Real Simple has had a great first few months in Japan, South Africa and Greece. And we are an important and valued part of the Time Warner portfolio from a business perspective. We balance out some of the other hit-driven divisions by providing a steady flow of cash to the company. 
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;We are fortunate that Time Inc. has some of the best and most trusted brands in the entire media landscape -- that's how we must think of our assets, as brands, not just magazines. And in a time of so much information, our core competency of trusted editing skills is what will prevail. Our new Editor in Chief John Huey and the talented editorial staff continue to produce the most compelling stories, photos and content, which the industry recognized at the National Magazine Awards two weeks ago. 
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;Working in an organization in times of change is hard. It requires a sustained effort that can take a personal toll on all of us, so I encourage you to maintain your internal compass. Teamwork and collaboration are crucial. I appreciate your focus during this period of transition and thank you for your hard work, professionalism and extraordinary talent which keep Time Inc. the industry leader by every measure. 
&lt;BR&gt;

        <title>Le Cirque Is Back! Yippee!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="right" alt="20060524lecirque.jpg" src="http://www.gawker.com/images/2006/05/20060524lecirque.jpg" width="170" height="94" /&gt;It doesn't officially open, for normal people, for another week. But, even so, today is apparently New Le Cirque day in the New York press. The are nearly 4,000 tag-teamed words on the cover of the &lt;I&gt;Observer&lt;/I&gt; about it -- and, in fairness, about the Bloomberg building in which it resides. David Carr has another 1,500 words on the front of the &lt;I&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; dining section about the restaurant and its many opening parties. There's even a Carpetbagging-style &lt;a href="http://video.on.nytimes.com/ifr_main.jsp?nsid=b-5be753b:10b66134afb:6bfa&amp;amp;fr_story=fc28f992d8ef8ff402c626d9f35d0f36fcc29520&amp;amp;st=1148477799590&amp;amp;mp=WMP&amp;amp;cpf=true&amp;amp;fr=052406_093655_w5be753bx10b66134afbx6bfb&amp;amp;rdm=286011.2511834754"&gt;video report&lt;/a&gt; on the opening party on the &lt;I&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; site, reminding us of both Le Cirque's fabulosity and why Carr became a print reporter in the first place. The message of all of this? That it's a big, very fancy, important restaurant for a big, fancy, very important people. That it's exclusive and in-demand, and high society is quietly calculating how to get a table and which table to want to get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we won't mention that when we called the other day, we easily got exactly the reservation we wanted for our parents' upcoming wedding anniversary, and we didn't even have to pretend to be big, fancy, or important. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We Feel Genuinely Sad for Diane Sawyer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="poordiane.jpg" src="http://www.gawker.com/images/2006/05/poordiane.jpg" width="134" height="183" class="right"/&gt;David Blum heads to the &lt;i&gt;Sun&lt;/i&gt; today, where he pens a column that asks the real question about the network news anchor shuffle -- and it doesn't have a single thing to do with Katie Couric, Charlie Gibson, or Brian Williams. The real issue: &lt;i&gt;What the motherfuck is Diane Sawyer going to do now?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sawyer's been at &lt;i&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/i&gt; for 6 years, and who how she'll come off without Gibson's warm fuzzies. She's wanted the anchor gig for all of her 60 years, but those slots are filled. Until someone eventually mauls Oprah, Sawyer's only other option (besides staying at &lt;i&gt;GMA&lt;/i&gt;) is anchoring &lt;i&gt;PrimeTime Live&lt;/i&gt;. As if she'd deign to compete with Ann Curry and Stone Phillips? Oh, hell no. Nobody deserves that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not fair, but there's only one solution: Boca. &lt;/p&gt;

If you can ignore the usual Stern propaganda, he does take a discerning eye to the &lt;i&gt;Times&lt;/i&gt; and notices that the Gray Lady sure does love to delicately dance:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>It's Lonely 'Round Page Six</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="psixlogolg.jpg" src="http://www.gawker.com/images/2006/05/psixlogolg.jpg" width="155" height="201" class="right"/&gt;Today's &lt;i&gt;Observer&lt;/i&gt; reveals that in the wake of Jared Paul Stern and Burkle-gate, Page Six has been looking for a full-time staffer to accompany Paula Froelich and Chris Wilson on their magical, gossipy journey. Unfortunately, several people have turned down the offer. According to Gabe Sherman, that list includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8226; Jacob Bernstein &lt;br /&gt;

&amp;#8226; Derek Blasberg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that's by no means a complete rundown. Others who've declined the golden ticket:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bouncer Goes Above and Beyond, Kills Patrons</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="opus22.jpg" src="http://www.gawker.com/images/2006/05/opus22.jpg" width="200" height="103" class="right"/&gt;Gunfire broke out at West Chelsea stripey den Opus 22 last night, resulting in one dead and three wounded. The culprit? &lt;i&gt;The bouncer&lt;/i&gt;, of course. You know, the dude that's there for safety and crowd control [insert obligatory Darryl Littlejohn shout-out]. The victims were at a private open-mic party at the club and were asked to leave to make way for another event. They were allowed to reenter the club but had to pay a $20 entrance fee; the intoxicated patrons refused:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The guy had a few too many and he kept acting up and I guess the bouncer decided to resolve this by shooting him," one witness said. "He pulled a gun and got him point-blank in the chest," in front of the club, the witness said.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;When the mortally wounded man fell to the pavement, one of his buddies confronted Sakai, yelling, "Why did you shoot my friend?" another witness said. "The bouncer asked him, 'You want some, too?' and then shot him, too."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this considered dedication to the bouncing craft? And if so, who's going to guard you from nightlife's guardians? &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Oprahs Revels In Anderson's Misfortune</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="right" alt="20060523acoprah2.jpg" src="http://www.gawker.com/images/2006/05/20060523acoprah2.jpg" width="200" height="153" /&gt;So we're watching Anderson on &lt;I&gt;Oprah&lt;/I&gt; right now -- how could we not? -- and, as Jossip promised this morning, we don't think it tells us anything we didn't already know. But that doesn't mean there's not some interest in the retelling of the old stories -- and especially in Oprah's weird fixation on, of all the details in Anderson's life, his brother's suicide in 1988. She talks about it with him, she talks about it with his mom, Gloria Vanderbilt, and she even goes so far as to bring him up to the East Side building where he grew up, and from which his brother jumped, which Anderson hasn't visited in something like 15 years. "What was that like for you, going back?" Oprah asks after showing the clip. "Yeah, it wasn't really pleasant," Anderson answers. A few moments later comes a commercial break, with a teaser for Oprah's upcoming trip to Auschwitz with Elie Wiesel. "See the Holocaust through the eyes of the man who lived it," she says in a voiceover. "Tomorrow!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman is sick.&lt;/p&gt;
