			<title>Planting blogging seeds</title>
			<link>http://anvil.gsu.edu/EduBlogInsights/2005/01/25#a914</link>
			<description>&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;This morning I had the
opportunity to teach a group of preservice teachers about weblogs. The
instructor in the class has created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typepad.com&quot;&gt;Typepad &lt;/a&gt;weblog called &lt;a href=&quot;http://itc.blogs.com/management/&quot;&gt;Classroom Management that Works&lt;/a&gt;. She is planning to use it to invite discussion through the comment feature.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Michelle focuses on student input....&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Hi Mrs. Jordan,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;I love all the great ideas presented in the weblog technology class! I 
especially like the opportunity for students to make suggestions regarding 
classroom instruction. I feel student input is the best way to keep lessons 
engaging and interesting for all involved. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Michelle Mayne&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;
Denise is considering possibilities....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Weblogs present many possibilities for use in the classroom. I am considering 
using a weblog during my classroom placement in the Netherlands to communicate 
with a classroom here in the States.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 102);&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;Denise Born&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Go read the 27 other&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://itc.blogs.com/management/2005/01/welcome.html#comments&quot;&gt;comments &lt;/a&gt;about
today&apos;s session. I love it when I have the opportunity to talk to a
large group like this. They are exploring possible uses for down the
road.&amp;nbsp; They begin student teaching next semester.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I&apos;m planting blogging seeds and looking for sprouts.......&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</description>

			<title>Talking about blogging on TappedIn</title>
			<link>http://anvil.gsu.edu/EduBlogInsights/2005/01/21#a873</link>
			<description>&lt;font style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot; size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;This morning I had the opportunity to talk about blogging&amp;nbsp; to twenty-five educators from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/ehansonsmi/evo2005/blogs.html&quot;&gt;EVOnline Course &lt;/a&gt;that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastasiacenter.net/apcampbell/&quot;&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://beewebhead.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Bee&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog-efl.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Graham &lt;/a&gt;are conducting. We used &lt;a href=&quot;http://tappedin.org/tappedin/&quot;&gt;TappedIn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tappedin.org/tappedin/&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; Here&apos;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ed-edublogs.gsu.edu/%7Eadmin2/static/EduBlogInsights/TappedInTranscriptEV05.doc&quot;&gt;transcript &lt;/a&gt;for anyone who is interested. &amp;nbsp;  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I have a feeling some good blogging is going to come out of that group! &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

			<title>Dear Teacher-To-Be</title>
			<link>http://anvil.gsu.edu/EduBlogInsights/2005/01/21#a871</link>
			<description>&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;We&apos;re making
connections using weblogs! My fifth grade blogging students posted
&quot;Dear Teacher-To-Be posts. My GSU students (who will be our future
teachers) are just now learning about blogging. They replied in the
comments section to the students. Here&apos;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://itc.blogs.com/patrick/2005/01/dearteachertobe.html&quot;&gt;sample from Patrick&lt;/a&gt;:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(51, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Dear Teacher-To-Be,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; My name is Patrick from the weblog group. If you&apos;re going to be a
good teacher you have to be nice to your students. If you respect them,
they&apos;ll respect you. Most students don&apos;t like to be bossed around so
much, so if they do something bad don&apos;t be so hard on them. Help them
understand what they did wrong. Try to be a funny teacher who will make
them laugh so if they&apos;re mad it might help them forget why they were so
mad. Also try to learn as much as you can about your students. Try
sitting with them at lunch so you can learn more about them. Try sitting
with at least every one of them over the weeks.. Be just like my teacher,
Mrs.Mateling. She taught my brother and mother when they were in fifth
grade. Mrs.Mateling is a good example of an good teacher. She&apos;s really
nice to most of us, well all of us. She is really funny and she tries
to get to know all about us. You try to be like Mrs. Mateling and
you&apos;ll be a good teacher too. Also I forgot you should do fun activites
with your students. Sometimes let them do group work to keep them happy
and they&apos;ll like you alot. That&apos;s all I have to say so bye!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;To which Christen (my GSU student) replied:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(102, 51, 102);&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Hey Patrick! Thanks for the great advice! I hope to teach the 4th or
5th grade soon and I need advice from students. I really liked what you
said about taking time to get to know each student. That is a tip I
will use when I become a teacher. Thank you so much! If you have
anymore advice for me, please email me!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;color: rgb(102, 51, 102);&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;One more thing, Patrick - I love what you said about respect. I think that is the most important thing in a classroom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks Again, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christen Gibbons&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;color: rgb(102, 51, 102);&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;The
best part of the day was watching the smiles on the GSU students faces as they read
the posts from the elementary students. Yep, it&apos;s all about
connections. and of course, as Patrick says, &quot;Learn all about your
students.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;I received an email from Henry Teach who had seen a page from our Electronic Village (EV) Online Session 2004 on &lt;a href=&quot;http://anvil.gsu.edu/ev/&quot;&gt;Weblogs in ESL&lt;/a&gt;. His organization has set up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.free-esl-blogs.com/default.asp&quot;&gt;free esl blog service&lt;/a&gt;
for teachers and students. He says it is extremely easy to use and
dsigned for those in and around the esl industry. I haven&apos;t had a
chance to check it out but wanted to post it for those who may be
interested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

			<title>Testing, Technology, Writing &amp; Learning</title>
			<link>http://anvil.gsu.edu/EduBlogInsights/2005/01/18#a853</link>
			<description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Geneva,Arial,Sans-Serif&gt;The New York Times has an article on &quot;&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/17/technology/17test.html&quot;&gt;Measuring Literacy in a World Gone Digital.&quot;&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; Excerpts from the article:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Geneva,Arial,Sans-Serif&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=teal&gt;Today, in a matter of minutes, students can identify these and thousands of other potential resources on the Internet - and, as any teacher will attest, they are not always adept at sorting the wheat from the chaff. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=teal&gt;Now the Educational Testing Service, the nonprofit group behind the SAT, Graduate Record Examination and other college tests, has developed a new test that it says can assess students&apos; ability to make good critical evaluations of the vast amount of material available to them. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=teal&gt;The Information and Communications Technology literacy assessment, which will be introduced at about two dozen colleges and universities later this month, is intended to measure students&apos; ability to manage exercises like sorting e-mail messages or manipulating tables and charts, and to assess how well they organize and interpret information from many sources and in myriad forms. About 10,000 undergraduates at schools from the University of California, Los Angeles to Bronx Community College are expected to take the test during the first offering period, which ends March 31. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=teal&gt;Still, just what is meant by &apos;information &apos;or even &apos;technological&apos; literacy remains a hotly debated topic in academic circles, and there is no widespread agreement on whether such skills can be taught, much less measured in a test. What seems certain, however, is that a lucrative market is emerging for testing companies that are willing to fill the perceived need. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=teal&gt;The initial technology test is aimed at midlevel college students, but the Educational Testing Service says it has also received inquiries from high schools and businesses. And while the new assessment is not a high-stakes requirement for academic advancement like the SAT, it seems inevitable that most students will one day need to prove themselves along these lines. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=black&gt;Everybody keeps talking about accountability and point out how the public wants this but I think it&apos;s time that we used multiple ways to assess. Also we need to be focusing on reshaping our curriculum to meet the needs of the infomation age.&amp;nbsp; Rather than the dreaded weeklong testing sessions that occur in schools each year, we need to move tests&amp;nbsp; into the background as but one source of&amp;nbsp;data combined with many others to assess learning. Assessment should have an instructional purpose, not just an evaluative or administrative one. I am really concerned that tests are taking over as our focus on learning. We need to focus on improving the quality of student work.&amp;nbsp;I&apos;m fearful of how the testing of technology can be translated to a standardized test. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=black&gt;How about&amp;nbsp;if we made writing the focus of learning?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We&apos;d be much better off than using testing. Writing can be a tool for learning in all disciplines. Actually the National Center for Education Statistics in the U.S. Department of cf Ecucation says it all here:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=teal&gt;Effective writing skills are important in all stages of life from early education to future employment. In the business world, as well as in school, students must convey complex ideas and information in a clear, succinct manner. Inadequate writing skills, therefore, could inhibit achievement across the curriculum and in future careers, while proficient writing skills help students convey ideas, deliver instructions, analyze information, and motivate others.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hmmm, how about if we took the time spent&amp;nbsp;on getting kids ready for tests and instead focused on writing as a means to improve learning in our schools?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I also keep thinking about all the learning possibilities that the Read/Write Web provides and we are at the beginning stages of so many teachers beginning to rethink teaching, technology to help students make learning connections. Testing of technology by a standardized test could just shut the door on all this. We&apos;re at a critical &amp;nbsp;junction. Let&apos;s not reduce technology to a &quot;test-prep&quot; mode.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;</description>

			<title>Blog Studies</title>
			<link>http://anvil.gsu.edu/EduBlogInsights/2005/01/12#a813</link>
			<description>&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 102);&quot;&gt;The
use of Internet technology to facilitate interaction, communication,
and collaboration is well documented but its use in establishing and
developing &quot;personal voice&quot; as part of learning is also now being
addressed through the use of blogs. Finding personal voice as a
pedagogical method is important to establish learner identity and
focus, and journaling has long been recognized as an effective way to
provide space for this to occur. The blog, however, provides a context
in which personal voice can be &quot;published&quot; by the student, which means
that attention is given to content, relevancy, and connection with
learning outcomes to a higher degree than a traditional journal
submission. The idea that more than one person will view the work is
quite powerful in promoting a sense of ownership from the student.
Teachers can also benefit from &quot;hearing&quot; the personal voice of their
students to begin to really understand the learning path of each
student through a course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The above is the opening paragraph in an article, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campus-technology.com/news_article.asp?id=10473&amp;typeid=156&quot;&gt;Blogs in Higher Ed: Personal Voice as Part of Learning&lt;/a&gt;, published by Ruth Reynard in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campus-technology.com/news_issue.asp?id=154&quot;&gt;eLearning Dialogue.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;I am glad to see studies like this coming out. The focus of this study was to answer these questions:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;Is blogging perceived as a good way to establish personal voice by both students and instructors?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;Is there a tension created by the published nature of the blog?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;What do instructors need to do to contextualize blogging in a course?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;In the first study
blogs were uses as a reflective tool and each student recived a grade
for their blog. The grade was based on the number of posts, not on the
content. Students were to reflect on course readings or personal
experience. The conclusion was that students found this more of a
&quot;chore and were focused only on completing it for the grade. The
instructor&apos;s comments were included. Those are interesting and lend
insight into the study. This instructor felt it is important to model
reflection and provide more guiding questions for the students. The
next plan is to try to use blogs to support more ownership of the
context from the students.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the second study blogging was used as a journaling tool but was
optional. Out of 25 students, only 3 chose to blog. Those three enjoyed
the convenience and visual permanency of the blog. They discovered that
it made their sequencing easier in terms of thought progression. The
instructor felt that students within a class sharing their blog with
specific individuals t prompt response could be encouraged to support
small group connection and student-to-student support. He thought this
could probably provide more learning support than discussion boards
and/or chat.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The third study consisted of 27 students who blogged. They were in a
first-year creative writing class and were to blog twice a week on any
topic that interested them. A few times the instructor gave them a
topic. No grade was assigned.&amp;nbsp; Most students enjoyed this at
first, a few didn&apos;t like it, five were very excited about it. One hated
it at first but is now hooked and continues to blog. This instructor
enjoyed blogging and checking student blogs. Blogging will contine next
semester.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the fourth study 6 students participated in a language support
group. The project will continue next semester and be assessed more
carefully. Students have found that a blogring is helpful in staying
connected.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Summary and Recommendations from the article:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 102);&quot;&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Blogging must be integrated early in the course design and must be clearly 
connected to the course outcomes before it can become anything more than just an 
extra task for the students. 
    &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Grading does seem to motivate the students, but it seems to be more 
effective to grade according to effort in relevancy to course content and 
outcomes than simply on numbers of submissions. 
    &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;There is an issue with privacy, particularly with older students. This 
should be addressed by emphasizing how to secure and share entries. 
    &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;Instructors need time to evaluate the importance of self-reflection as a 
methodological approach in learning as well as the value of integrating personal 
voice in the learning context. Otherwise the exercise will be perceived as 
futile to the students.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;Small samplings here
but it&apos;s a beginning. I am glad to see these type of studies coming
out. The good news is that they are going to continue the studies.
They are also going to attempt to better prepare each instructor by
discussing how blogging relates to course outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

			<title>One thing leads to another.....</title>
			<link>http://anvil.gsu.edu/EduBlogInsights/2005/01/11#a811</link>
			<description>&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;On the web one thing
does lead to another. I know you all have experienced that as you surf
the web looking for good resources. I want to share one that I continue
to use in so many ways. I hope you will find it useful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://magazines.fasfind.com/wwwtools/&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://magazines.fasfind.com/wwwtools/&quot;&gt;wwwtools for teachers&lt;/a&gt;
is one of my favorite resources on the web. It is created by educators
for educators. Some days I feel information overload to the nth degree
but I find myself frequently returning to this wonderful collection of
key web resources, organized by topics. Recent articles can be viewed
by anyone; however if the articles are older than 3 months it requires
a paid subscription to access them. It is well worth it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;You as the reader can even suggest a topic by sending a &apos;research&apos; request to them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Then I found this concise little tutorial on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/about/index.php&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Maricopa Center for Learning and Instruction&amp;nbsp; (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/about/index.php&quot;&gt;mcli) &lt;/a&gt;on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/resources.php?type=ext&amp;id=wwwtools&quot;&gt;How to Access and Use wwwtools&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;Their latest issue is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://magazines.fasfind.com/wwwtools/m/1944.cfm?x=0&amp;rid=1944&quot;&gt;Directions from 2004, Trends for 2005.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;
					&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://magazines.fasfind.com/wwwtools/magazines.cfm?x=0&amp;cuID=73&quot;&gt;Online Resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt; 
					&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;They tuned into the fact that every
year in January pundits, experts and others share their thoughts on
what they believe will be the major IT themes during the new year.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;In my &quot;one thing leads to another&quot; thought, as I was viewing some of
the excellent links from this issue I found an interesting quote on a
post on Trevor Cook&apos;s blog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://trevorcook.typepad.com/election/&quot;&gt;From the Sidelines&lt;/a&gt;. The post is &lt;a href=&quot;http://trevorcook.typepad.com/election/2005/01/here_comes_ever.html&quot;&gt;Here Comes Everything: Can Technology Serve Information Overload?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt; His quote about his article:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;In just 2000 words it covers search engines, SEO, google bombing, podcasting, 
RSS, real-time searching, bloggercon, scoble, bradbury, and more. The basic 
argument is that the way to manage information effectively is to use bloggers as 
your intelligent agents.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;This wwwtools for educators issue opened&amp;nbsp; with this quote from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot; href=&quot;http://ei.cs.vt.edu/%7Ehistory/GASCH.KAY.HTML&quot;&gt;Alan Kay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;
&quot;The best way to predict the future is to invent it.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Blogs can
be a&amp;nbsp; vehicle to help with inventing the future. Let&apos;s use them in
education!&amp;nbsp; My
prediction, or maybe I should say my hope, is that conversations on
blogs will be used in ways to reshape many needed changes in
education. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

			<title>Using Comments to Teach Critical Thinking</title>
			<link>http://anvil.gsu.edu/EduBlogInsights/2005/01/10#a807</link>
			<description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;Giving students
comment starters helps them respond to a post in thoughtful ways. Then
they can take it a step further and create their own starters as they
progress in thinking critically. Here are some examples from the
blooming bloggers group:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Shelby&apos;s comment to Alejandro on &lt;a href=&quot;http://itc.blogs.com/alejandro/2004/12/_my_life_as_a_w.html#comments&quot;&gt;My Life as a Weblogger:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;
Your writing made me form an opinion about weblogging. My NEW opinion
is that blogging is not just about writing, but is also about learning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;
Aha! An opinion is being formed.....&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Yessenia&apos;s comment to Ashley on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://itc.blogs.com/ashley/2004/12/the_weblogging_.html&quot;&gt;Weblogging Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itc.blogs.com/ashley/2004/12/the_weblogging_.html&quot;&gt;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;
When you write you&amp;nbsp; make it seem as if it is a conversation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Making connections! A student is taking note of&amp;nbsp; the relationships between readers and writers. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;Adriena responds to Estefany&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://itc.blogs.com/estefany/2004/12/the_learner_.html&quot;&gt;The Learner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itc.blogs.com/estefany/2004/12/the_learner_.html&quot;&gt;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;
I am just like you. I put my best foot ahead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Thinking about learning! A comparison is being made....&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Patrick comments on Jhonathan&apos;s post about the&lt;a href=&quot;http://itc.blogs.com/jhonathan/2004/12/_importance_of_.html&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itc.blogs.com/jhonathan/2004/12/_importance_of_.html&quot;&gt;Importance of Weblogs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itc.blogs.com/jhonathan/2004/12/_importance_of_.html&quot;&gt;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;
I think that is a good way to write because the way you put your words
in it. You make it seem like you was really talking to somebody. I can
tell you&apos;re going to be a good blogger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Using facts to anticipate possible results! A prediction is given.....&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;Shelby muses after reading Jhonathan&apos;s post on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://itc.blogs.com/jhonathan/2004/10/history_channel.html#comments&quot;&gt;History Channel&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 153, 153);&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;After reflecting on your post, I decided that from now on, I will start
to watch the History Channel a little more. I do have a suggestion. You
should always make sure that you posts are spelled correctly and they
make sense. (I think thats how you spell it)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(51, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;
I have a question for you. Do you like watching mysteries?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Whoa! A mind is being changed.......&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

			<title>Hillary Gets It!</title>
			<link>http://anvil.gsu.edu/EduBlogInsights/2005/01/06#a796</link>
			<description>&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;I am so excited about getting some of the faculty at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockdale.k12.ga.us&quot;&gt;J. H. House&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; up and going on blogs this year.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
Hillary, the instructional technology specialist, really gets blogging.
I mean REALLY gets it!&amp;nbsp; When you have a colleague who turns a
corner and understands the joy of blogging, the power of the learning
and also sees future possibilities....well, it doesn&apos;t get much better
than that.&amp;nbsp; Hillary says &lt;a href=&quot;http://anvil.gsu.edu/EduBlogQuest/2005/01/05#a139&quot;&gt;Learning to Write is Learning to Think &lt;/a&gt;and I couldn&apos;t agree more. This is a great read and if you haven&apos;t added Hillary to your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com&quot;&gt;Bloglines&lt;/a&gt; list you need to. An excerpt from her blog:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial; color: rgb(51, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;However, the most difficult aspect of writing our students constantly
describe is not plagiarizing.&amp;nbsp; Why is this so difficult for our young
aspiring writers?&amp;nbsp; Well, it is just as difficult for&amp;nbsp;me as it is for
them!&amp;nbsp;Since the&amp;nbsp;original&amp;nbsp;author seems to say it so much better, it
seems logical for our students to use their words.&amp;nbsp; That is where
thinking comes in!&amp;nbsp; Learning to write is learning to&amp;nbsp;think.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Although
it seems as&amp;nbsp;though we have few original&amp;nbsp;thoughts, we do have our&amp;nbsp;own
original way of&amp;nbsp;viewing things.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We must&amp;nbsp;take into consideration
everything we have done up to this point&amp;nbsp;in our life&amp;nbsp;and use it in
shaping our thoughts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Then we use those thoughts to analyze,
reject,&amp;nbsp;embrace, and/or argue with the work of&amp;nbsp;others in order to grow
intellectually. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Hillary is sure doing some good thinking and what&apos;s really cool is that she is modeling that thinking for the kids. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And I&apos;m starting to soar again.....&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
